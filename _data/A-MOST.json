This paper presents a suite of in-process metrics that leverages the software testing effort to create a defect density prediction model for use throughout the software development process. A case study conducted with Galois Connections, Inc. in a Haskell programming environment indicates that the resulting defect density prediction is indicative of the actual system defect density.","cites":"10","conferencePercentile":"77.77777778"}]}
