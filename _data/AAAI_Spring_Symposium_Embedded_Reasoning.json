In this paper, we present RASCL, the Robotic Assistance System for Changing Lanes. RASCL combines state-of-the-art sensing and localization techniques with an accurate map describing road structure to detect and track other cars, determine whether or not a lane change to either side is safe, and communicate these safety statuses to the user using a variety of audio and visual interfaces. The user can interact with the system through specifying the size of their \" comfort zone \" , engaging the turn signal, or by simply driving across lane dividers. Additionally, RASCL provides speed change recommendations that are predicted to turn an unsafe lane change situation into a safe situation and enables communication with other vehicles by automatically controlling the turn signal when the driver attempts to change lanes without using the turn signal.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"80"}]}
