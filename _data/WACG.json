Nonetheless, for applications of image synthesis such as lighting design or architectural simulation, we have to deal with dynamic environments. To make the method usable in a real case, the illumination has to be updated as fast as possible after an object moves. The efficient way is to find the calculations strictly necessary to be recomputed after a change in the scene. The largest part of the computation time is spent on visibility calculation. In this paper, we investigate the possible speed ups in those calculations. We propose the use of the visibility complex for radiosity calculations. The presented study is realized for 2D scenes of convex objects in the static case. We show that the visibility complex is very suitable for radiosity calculations in this context, and that it also allows for efficient updates in the dynamic case.","cites":"15","conferencePercentile":"75"}]}
