More knowledge is required for assessing the possible contributions of multiple sources of information for predicting students' emotions. In this paper we describe an ontology that we have implemented for predicting students' emotions when interacting with a quiz about Java programming. An experimental study with 17 computer science students compares the automatic predictions made by the ontology with the emotions self-reported by students.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"50"}]}
