Nonlinearity in an HVS introduced by omnidirectional cameras poses challenges for computing pixel correspondences among images. In previous HVSs, cameras must be calibrated by performing registration. In this paper, we propose a non-linear approach for registering images in an HVS without requiring calibration of cameras. We first discuss the homographies between omnidirectional and perspective images under a local pla-nar assumption. We then propose a robust patch level registration algorithm by exploiting a constraint on large 3D spatial planes. The proposed approach enables an HVS for applications that require quick deployment or active cameras. Experimental results have demonstrated feasibility of the proposed approach.","cites":"5","conferencePercentile":"36.9047619"},{"venue":"WACV/MOTION","id":"6864f78a15d49c9b7806cbc4204808782872dc28","venue_1":"WACV/MOTION","year":"2005","title":"Reliable Automatic Calibration of a Marker-Based Position Tracking System","authors":"David Claus, Andrew W.

Fisher, Trevor Darrell","author_ids":"2588636, 1733063, 1753210","abstract":"Adaptive background modeling/subtraction techniques are popular, in particular, because they are able to cope with background variations that are due to lighting variations. Unfortunately these models also tend to adapt to foreground objects that become stationary for a period of time; as a result such objects are no longer considered for further processing. In this paper, we propose the first (to our knowledge) statistically consistent method for incorporating feedback from high-level motion model to modify adaptation behavior. Our approach is based on formulating the background maintenance problem as inference in a continuous state Hidden Markov Model, and combining it with a similarly formulated object tracker in a multichain graphical model framework. We demonstrate that the approximate filtering algorithm in such a framework outperforms the common feed-forward system while not imposing a significant extra computational burden.","cites":"7","conferencePercentile":"43.45238095"},{"venue":"WACV/MOTION","id":"bdd4fe6a4a47fcef1f21df16b873867b45031876","venue_1":"WACV/MOTION","year":"2005","title":"A Factorization Method for Structure from Planar Motion","authors":"Jian Li, Rama Chellappa","author_ids":"1701502, 1712305","abstract":"We propose a factorization method for structure from pla-nar motion using a stationary perspective camera.

The measurement matrix has a rank of at most 3, instead of 4; the measurement matrix needs similar scalings, but estimation of fundamental matrices or epipoles is not needed; we have an Euclidean reconstruction instead of a projective reconstruction. The camera is not required to be calibrated. A simple semi-automatic calibration method using vanishing points and lines is sufficient.

Such methods combine multi-view reconstruction with motion estimation approaches. This paper describes an alternative formulation for dense scene flow estimation that provides convincing results using only two cameras by fusing stereo and optical flow estimation into a single coherent framework. To handle the aperture problems inherent in the estimation task, a multi-scale method along with a novel adaptive smoothing technique is used to gain a regularized solution. This combined approach both preserves discon-tinuities and prevents over-regularization â€“ two problems commonly associated with basic multi-scale approaches. Internally, the framework generates probability distributions for optical flow and disparity. Taking into account the uncertainty in the intermediate stages allows for more reliable estimation of the 3D scene flow than standard stereo and optical flow methods allow.

In response, we present a thorough study investigating the effects of training data quantity, measurement error, pixel coordinate noise, and the choice of camera model, on camera calibration results. Through this effort, we seek to determine whether expensive, elaborate setups are necessary, or indeed, beneficial, to camera calibration, and whether a high complexity camera model leads to improved accuracy. The results are first provided for a simulated camera system and then verified through carefully controlled experiments using real-world measurements.","cites":"4","conferencePercentile":"29.16666667"},{"venue":"WACV/MOTION","id":"47b090627870448d78a14716f528122bf359e438","venue_1":"WACV/MOTION","year":"2005","title":"Learning the Behavior of Users in a Public Space through Video Tracking","authors":"Wei Yan, David A.

Previously, such measurements could only be obtained through costly manual processes, e.g. behavioral mapping and time-lapse filming with human examiners. Our system has automated the process of analyzing the behavior of users. The system consists of a head detector for detecting people in each single frame of the video and data association for tracking people through frames. We compared the results obtained using our system with those obtained by manual counting, for a small data set, and found the results to be fairly accurate. We then applied the system to a large-scale data set and obtained substantial statistical measurements of parameters such as the total number of users who entered the space, the total number of users who sat by a fountain, the time that each spent by the fountain, etc. These statistics allow fundamental rethinking of the way people use a public space.","cites":"19","conferencePercentile":"73.21428571"},{"venue":"WACV/MOTION","id":"a7666e8ad4881a205e35cfb94037cd369a13c80f","venue_1":"WACV/MOTION","year":"2005","title":"Predictive and Probabilistic Tracking to Detect Stopped Vehicles","authors":"Rudy Melli, Andrea Prati, Rita Cucchiara, Lieven de Cock","author_ids":"2881572, 1733945, 1741922, 2697424","abstract":"Many techniques and models have been proposed for vehicles surveillance in highways.

In this study we extend the binary visual hull to an implicit surface in order to capture the geometry of the visual hull itself.

Diel, Paul DeBitetto, Seth J. Teller","author_ids":"2536518, 7174659, 1720894","abstract":"â€” This paper describes a new method to improve inertial navigation using feature-based constraints from one or more video cameras. The proposed method lengthens the period of time during which a human or vehicle can navigate in GPS-deprived environments. Our approach integrates well with existing navigation systems, because we invoke general sensor models that represent a wide range of available hardware. The inertial model includes errors in bias, scale, and random walk. Any purely projective camera and tracking algorithm may be used, as long as the tracking output can be expressed as ray vectors extending from known locations on the sensor body. A modified linear Kalman filter performs the data fusion. Unlike traditional SLAM, our state vector contains only inertial sensor errors related to position. This choice allows uncertainty to be properly represented by a covariance matrix. We do not augment the state with feature coordinates. Instead, image data contributes stochastic epipolar constraints over a broad baseline in time and space, resulting in improved observability of the IMU error states. The constraints lead to a relative residual and associated relative covariance, defined partly by the state history. Navigation results are presented using high-quality synthetic data and real fisheye imagery. I. NAVIGATION PROBLEM An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a common component in modern navigation systems. A typical IMU contains three accelerometers and three gyroscopes that provide information about the motion of a moving body [1]. Unfortunately , the process of extracting body position estimates from IMU output leads to significant drift over time. The Global Positioning System (GPS) provides complementary, absolute position information. However, circumstances such as sky occlusion, hardware failure, and war may disallow GPS signals. Therefore, we turn to vision as an alternative source of information. We would like to navigate in places where people go on foot or in a wheeled vehicle. These environments happen to share some important visual characteristics: 1) Most of the scene remains stationary with respect to the planet's surface; and 2) For typical scenes, the ratio of body velocity to scene depth lies within a limited range. Other environments that meet these criteria include the sea floor and unexplored Variables t-time y ij-pixel radiance-relatively small number Ï„-interval of time (fixed) b b b-bias c c c ij-camera ray f f f-specific force g g g-gravity h h h-measurement gain k k k-Kalman gain n n n-white noise s s s-scale u u â€¦","cites":"36","conferencePercentile":"91.07142857"},{"venue":"WACV/MOTION","id":"14dbbeaef8a4896ef1751284d6a665740f9b6918","venue_1":"WACV/MOTION","year":"2005","title":"Robust Metric and Alignment for Profile-Based Face Recognition: An Experimental Comparison","authors":"Gang Pan, Lei Zheng, Zhaohui Wu","author_ids":"1734380, 1744827, 1687635","abstract":"The human facial profile curve provides complementary information of the face that is not present in the frontal-view face, which has been used in face identification, face analysis and modelling.

The advantage is that no detection of fiducial points is required, which is usually unreliable and hard to implement fully automatically. This paper also introduces three methods to align profiles, and investigates four similarity measures. The experiments on two profile image databases (Bern and FERET) and a facial range data set are carried out. The comparison with two primary approaches is conducted.

Noting that due to the longer exposure time required, high-resolution frames are more prone to motion blur than low-resolution frames, and thus, a motion blur reduction step is also applied.
