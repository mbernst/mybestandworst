Mansurul Alam Bhuiyan, Masud Hasan, Ishita Kamal Khan","author_ids":"2797310, 3137630, 3276276, 2154055","abstract":"The problem of cutting a convex polygon P out of a planar piece of material Q (P is already drawn on Q) with minimum total cutting cost is a well studied problem in computational geometry that has been studied with several variations such as P and Q are convex or non-convex polygons, Q is a circle, and the cuts are line cuts or ray cuts. In this paper, we address this problem without the restriction that P is fixed inside Q and consider the variation where Q is a circle and the cuts are line cuts. We show that if P can be placed inside Q such that P does not contain the center of Q, then placing P in a most cornered position inside Q gives a cutting cost of 6.48 times the optimal. We also give an O(n 2)-time algorithm for finding such a position of P , a problem that may be of independent interest. When any placement of P must contain the center of Q, we show that P can be cut of Q with cost 6.054 times the optimal.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"27.77777778"},{"venue":"WALCOM","id":"2013ce9cb94fd5a0bb769cfe948591b12cf3dc52","venue_1":"WALCOM","year":"2011","title":"Range-Aggregate Queries Involving Geometric Aggregation Operations","authors":"Saladi Rahul, Ananda Swarup Das, K.

Range-aggregate version of point enclosure queries, 1-d segment intersection, 2-d orthogonal segment intersection (with/without distance constraint) are revisited and we improve the existing results for these problems. We also provide semi-dynamic (insertions) solutions to some of these problems. This paper is the first attempt to provide dynamic solutions to problems involving geometric aggregation operations.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"50"},{"venue":"WALCOM","id":"e2ca7432d2c42b488a7b21cb450322497f673371","venue_1":"WALCOM","year":"2013","title":"Fixed-Orientation Equilateral Triangle Matching of Point Sets","authors":"Jasine Babu, Ahmad Biniaz, Anil Maheshwari, Michiel H.

We study G (P) graphs where is the class of downward equilateral triangles (ie. equilateral triangles with one of their sides parallel to the x-axis and the corner opposite to this side below that side). For point sets in general position, these graphs have been shown to be equivalent to half-Θ6 graphs and TD-Delaunay graphs. The main result in our paper is that for point sets P in general position, G (P) always contains a matching of size at least n−2 3 and this bound cannot be improved above n−1 3. We also give some structural properties of G (P) graphs, where is the class which contains both upward and downward equilateral triangles. We show that for point sets in general position, the block cut point graph of G (P) is simply a path. Through the equivalence of G (P) graphs with Θ6 graphs, we also derive that any Θ6 graph can have at most 5n − 11 edges, for point sets in general position.","cites":"6","conferencePercentile":"87.5"},{"venue":"WALCOM","id":"63d43c17de9214c14038301688890cbe784b3bff","venue_1":"WALCOM","year":"2014","title":"On Generalized Planar Skyline and Convex Hull Range Queries","authors":"Nadeem Moidu, Jatin Agarwal, Sankalp Khare, Kishore Kothapalli, K.

Our solutions are in the pointer machine model, for orthogonal range queries on a static point set. We solve the planar range maxima problem for two-sided, three-sided and four-sided queries. We achieve a query time of O(log n + c) using O(n) space for the two-sided case, where n denotes the number of stored points and c the number of colors reported. For the three-sided case, we achieve query time O(log 2 n + c log n) using O(n) space while for four-sided queries we answer queries in O(log 3 n + c log 2 n) using O(n log n) space. For the planar range convex hull problem, we provide a solution that answers queries in O(log 2 n + c log n) time, using O(n log 2 n) space.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"33.33333333"},{"venue":"WALCOM","id":"cadf84559aaa9c0c902a056d28e67384634b0449","venue_1":"WALCOM","year":"2009","title":"Shortest Gently Descending Paths","authors":"Mustaq Ahmed, Anna Lubiw, Anil Maheshwari","author_ids":"2612760, 1745436, 1720050","abstract":"A path from s to t on a polyhedral terrain is descending if the height of a point p never increases while we move p along the path from s to t. We introduce a generalization of the shortest descending path problem, called the shortest gently descending path (SGDP) problem, where a path descends, but not too steeply. The additional constraint to disallow a very steep descent makes the paths more realistic in practice. We give two approximation algorithms (more precisely, FPTASs) to solve the SGDP problem on general terrains.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"35.71428571"}]}
