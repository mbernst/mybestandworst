Extending the Little Man Computer paradigm developed by Stuart Madnick and John Donovan during the 1960s at MIT (where it was taught to all undergraduate computer science students), this paper describes a comparable development undertaken for disk and tape storage devices. A \"Little Man Storage\" paradigm is proposed to simplify the explanation of how storage devices function and how data is maintained by those devices.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"10"}]}
