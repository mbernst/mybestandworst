Protection may be applied to limit code to running in a certain place, make reverse engineering challenging, and even present difficulties running automated analysis tools. I present my experience with three code protection methods that I have used in my classes.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"50"},{"venue":"WCCCE","id":"b9ed265f2012f9ea20e4788f8f3db03acc8b9def","venue_1":"WCCCE","year":"2016","title":"Engagement and Sustainability in a Data Structures Course in C for Non-Specialists","authors":"Edwin M. Knorr, Christopher Thompson","author_ids":"1713458, 4706775","abstract":"This paper is an experience report that deals with engagement and sustainability in a data structures course in C for non-specialists. The course is offered annually to about 200 engineering students who are not in the computer engineering option. We describe and justify a variety of engaging and sustainable practices, and provide benefits and caveats from the lessons we learned. These may be useful to instructors who are interested in either creating such a course or using some of its practices, while trying to achieve both high engagement and high sustainability when teaching non-specialists.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"50"}]}
