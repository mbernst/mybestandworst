We review some of the challenges encountered and their impact on students' performance. After a faltering start using the Objects First methodology, we were able to refocus our curriculum using a Fundamentals First approach which resulted in less student frustration and lower course attrition. Over the course of the past decade Java has slowly become a unifying thread through a significant number of programming courses in our diploma and university transfer computing science programs.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"38.46153846"}]}
