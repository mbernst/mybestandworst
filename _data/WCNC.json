In this paper, we investigate into the route guidance problem in vehicular wireless network, and then propose two efficient routing algorithms, i.e., centralized route guidance and distributed route guidance, according to different situations. A hybrid framework is then proposed to provide optimized routing decisions in a uniform way. Simulation results in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) indicate that, our route guidance schemes achieve much better performance than traditional GPS-based navigation and randomized routing. I. INTRODUCTION It is well known that traffic congestions can cause serious problems, such as fuel consumption, air pollution and even economic problems. From Urban mobility report [1], the cost from traffic congestion now is more than $100 billion, nearly $750 for every commuter in the U.S. To mitigate this situation, effective route guidance system should be deployed, helping vehicles choosing faster routes to avoid congestions. Traditional route guidance schemes leverage GPS module in vehicles to find the shortest path from the source to destination. However, these methods offer limited help for the current congestion situations, which is mainly because: first, they are unaware of the real-time congestion situations; second, when all vehicles with the same requests are guided to the same shortest paths, this shortest path will face severe congestions and become far from the fastest path. To better solve the congestion problem, a new route guidance system which overcomes these limitations should be designed. Vehicular wireless network provides opportunities to design a more effective vehicle routing scheme than before to avoid traffic congestions. In this architecture, roadside access points (AP) are widely deployed [2] [3], which can provide wireless access to users in moving vehicles and support data sharing among drivers. Therefore, by sharing dynamic traffic information in this network, it is possible to mitigate the congestion problems and further reduce the travel time of drivers. In this paper we study the route guidance in vehicular networks , and propose two efficient routing algorithms according to different conditions. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows, 1) Based on the single-source single-destination pattern of the routing requests during peak time, we propose a centralized algorithm, Minimum-Cost Maximum-Flow based Routing (MCMF-R), for the route guidance problem , which …","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"21.64179104"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"901eca31a205632287df4566644fe92f1b4f02c0","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2009","title":"Virtual access points for disaster scenarios","authors":"Daniel Câmara, Nikolaos Frangiadakis, Fethi Filali, Antonio Alfredo Ferreira Loureiro, Nick Roussopoulos","author_ids":"1724063, 1744186, 2428603, 1757448, 1734183","abstract":"— This work focuses on increasing the network coverage for stream traffic in disaster scenarios, which is often critical for preventing damages to property and, most importantly, loss of life.

The failure of authentication via the selected network may cause unnecessary handover attempts. In this regard, trust information of networks is considered an important factor in handover decision making.

Motivated, respectively , by the necessity of executing applications in environments with no previous infrastructure and the demand for applications that share, in a satisfying manner, files through the Internet, MANETs and P2P applications have brought onto themselves some interest from the community. As a characteristic of the distributed model which they follow, such technologies face a difficult task of routing requests in a decentralized environment. In this paper we conducted a detailed study of a Gnutella-like application running over a Mobile Ad-hoc Network where three different protocols were considered. The results show that each of the protocols analyzed performed well in some scenarios for some metrics yet had drawbacks in others. I. INTRODUCTION The recently disseminated Peer-to-Peer (P2P) paradigm is the basis for both Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) and popular Internet P2P applications. The P2P paradigm has as its most significant particularity the fact that central units, which are responsible for managing and meeting the needs of the network, are non-existent. In this model, nodes have equivalent functionalities and provision capabilities and, as a consequence , are called \" peer \" entities. Every peer is able to send and reply to request messages originated from another one. This shows the dual interface of these peers, since they might play the role of servers and clients simultaneously. That is the reason why they are also named \" servents \" (servers/clients). Similarly to the architecture on which they are based, MANETs and P2P applications have only recently drawn attention to themselves. The growth of computing resources for mobile devices has been the key contributing factor to the dissemination of mobile ad-hoc networks. Moreover, the launch of new applications – such as rescue team management in disaster situations or the exchange of information in combat areas – generated an increase in demand for networks without previous infrastructure. On the other hand, the spread out of P2P applications can be attributed to their success as file sharing platforms – specially those that distribute MP3-compressed music tracks [1]. Based on the same paradigm, P2P application networks, which are composed by a set of servers implementing a P2P application, and MANETs have common characteristics and functionalities. In essence, both are self-organizing networks, have dynamic topology, and are responsible for routing queries in a distributed environment.","cites":"16","conferencePercentile":"66.78321678"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"74c7855af8b64d07a47f40ea9290e632b2470f67","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2009","title":"Implementing a cooperative MAC protocol for wireless video multicast","authors":"Özgü Alay, Zhe Xu, Thanasis Korakis, Yao Wang, Shivendra S.

A novel physical layer approach for secure wireless cooperative communications against eavesdropping is proposed in this paper. For an asynchronous cooperative communication network with a cluster of user nodes transmitting to a common destination, we propose an anti-eavesdropping space-time network coding (AE-STNC) scheme to prevent eavesdropping and overcome the problem of imperfect synchronization. In the proposed scheme, training symbols are first transmitted by the destination (í µí°·). Owing to channel reciprocity, each user node can obtain the channel state information (CSI) between itself and í µí°·, which is unavailable to the eavesdroppers. By exploiting such CSI, anti-eavesdropping encoding is designed for each user node to create high decoding error rate at the eavesdroppers and ensure successful decoding at í µí°·. Furthermore, the AE-STNC is designed to achieve full diversity at í µí°·. Power allocation subject to average power constraint is considered and the secure region against eavesdroppers is also investigated. Based on the proposed AE-STNC scheme, an anti-eavesdropping space-time-frequency coding (AE-STFNC) scheme is proposed for broad-band asynchronous cooperative communications.

We investigate the two major issues in opportunistic routing, the selection and the prioritization metric for the candidate set. The COR is presented to select and prioritize the candidate node with minimum expected cost. This candidate selection with low expected cost on each transmission constructs a throughput efficient routing path. The COR's robust packet handling strategy is also proposed to avoid duplicated transmission without forwarding list. With more efficient candidate set and packet handling, the average throughput improves by 76% and the end-to-end delay is reduced by 15% in our simulation results. I. INTRODUCTION Routing protocols for multi-hop wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have been extensively studied. Most of the conventional routing algorithms, such as DSR [1], AODV [2], DSDV [3], and LQSR [4], select the best sequence of the nodes between the source and the destination, and forwards each packet through the selected route. However, these packets are always to be transmitted along the fixed sequence, which fails to exploit benefits of the wireless broadcast and stochastic propagation. A novel routing protocol called opportunistic routing is motivated for the multi-hop WMNs to exploit the broadcast feature of unreliable wireless medium [5-8]. In the opportunistic routing, a node that overhears the transmission and is closer to the destination is allowed to participate in forwarding the packet. Multiple weak links which have the same destination are combined into a strong link; therefore, the feature of multiple paths can be utilized. Besides, instead of predetermining the multi-hop path, the opportunistic routing improves throughput by exploiting the opportunistic reception of candidate nodes to reduce the overhead of transmitting the packet. The procedure of opportunistic routing begins when a source node requests to transmit the packet via broadcast medium. After a random set of receiver nodes receive the packet, the subset of receiver nodes can be chosen as the next relaying candidate nodes. Then the priority of the candidate nodes is set to deliver the packet. Only one of the candidate nodes is selected to forward the packet instead of duplicate transmissions.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"36.61616162"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"86dd6ef981f44546db86502f899da07bfb146f48","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2010","title":"A Sender-Side TCP Enhancement for Startup Performance in High-Speed Long-Delay Networks","authors":"Xiao Lu, Ke Zhang, Cheng Peng Fu, Chuan Heng Foh","author_ids":"4143610, 1697503, 3038324, 1690137","abstract":"—Many previous studies have shown that traditional TCP slow-start algorithm suffers performance degradation in high-speed and long-delay networks.

Current P2P file sharing protocols for MANETs use either aggressive or reactive flooding techniques for their path selection and recovery. Both techniques represent extreme measures to deal with path failures and they either do too much or very little work in response to path failures. In this paper we present a new path selection and recovery mechanism (Reactive with Unicast Probing Messages) that is a balance between the above two techniques in terms of its control overhead and the resulting path quality. By introducing a new unicast messaging mechanism to the reactive flooding technique, a requesting node can probe its set of available paths for their roundtrip times and use the best one for its file transfer. Our new technique is based on unicast messaging which proves to be effective and requires low control overhead as per the results of our simulations. Running P2P file-sharing applications [1][2] is generally a challenging task because of the dynamic nature of such applications. Because of the inherited limitations of MANETs, P2P file sharing in MANETs is much more challenging than in conventional wired networks[3][4][5][6][7]. While wired networks only have to deal with a dynamic topology at the application level, MANET networks have to deal with a dynamic topology at both of the application level and the physical level as well as the known wireless limitations (bandwidth, memory, unreliable physical channel, battery and processing power). Because of that, special P2P file sharing protocols like ORION [8] and MPP [9][10] were specially designed to address the MANET requirements. File sharing applications usually run in two stages, they are the file search and the file transfer. During the file search stage, a requesting node (a node that is interested in downloading a certain file) would flood the network with a QUERY message that have a description of the requested file. Source nodes (nodes that have the requested file) receiving the QUERY message would usually reply back to the requesting node with a REPLY message indicating that they are willing to upload the requested file to it and providing the path that the requesting node should use to reach the source node.

However, it must adhere to the primary functionality of the network. For surveillance applications, the network must be regarded as dead if the required security level can not be provisioned. In this paper, we analyze the temporal resilience of the deployment quality in surveillance wireless sensor networks and propose several lifetime definitions. As a major conclusion of this work, deploying only the required number of sensors without redundancy to provide the initial deployment quality threshold is the best strategy in favor of the network lifetime. I. INTRODUCTION Suppose that a perimeter is to be monitored by the wireless sensor networks to detect the unauthorized intruders. For example, fugitives try to cross the country border illegally. The objective of the intruder is to pass unnoticed through the border to reach the secured side. The deployment quality can be defined informally as the security level provided by the network and is a well studied topic for a snapshot in the lifetime of the surveillance wireless sensor network (SWSN). However, the sensors are prone to failures because of many factors such as power depletions. Consequently, the deployment quality diminishes in time. The effect of sensor failures on the sensing capability needs a rigorous analysis. This view point poses a research challenge: temporal resilience of the deployment quality. For surveillance applications, the network lifetime definitions must be revised according to the temporal characteristics of the sensing coverage. The principle stated in [1] is that the network lifetime definition must consider the capability of the network towards satisfying the design purpose. The simplistic network lifetime definition depends on the assumption that the network dies when the first sensor runs out of battery [2]. Considering just the ratio of alive sensors is acceptable for applications of wireless sensor networks where periodic messaging with a balanced routing strategy is implemented. However, the event generations in surveillance applications are not deterministic, and the death of several sensors may not cause significant degradation in the quality of the deployment. The network can be considered operational as long as it provides the required security level. In this work, we analyze the temporal behavior of the deployment quality with a discrete event simulation model. In the next section, we present the deployment quality measures and the related network lifetime definitions.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"8.415841584"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"fff4c761a04dc33c71b3993ee314bd8efe119cd7","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2015","title":"Evaluation of dynamic sensitivity control algorithm for IEEE 802.11ax","authors":"Muhammad Shahwaiz Afaqui, Eduard Garcia Villegas, Elena López-Aguilera, Graham Smith, Daniel Camps-Mur","author_ids":"3278373, 2618162, 1717905, 7820471, 2954828","abstract":"—The explosive growth in the usage of IEEE 802.11 network has resulted in dense deployments in diverse environments.

I. INTRODUCTION Orthogonal Frequencey Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier transmission scheme that is well-recognized for it's potential for attaining high rate transmission over frequency selective channels. OFDM is thus a promising candidate for mobile broadband wireless and has already been adopted in many high rate wireless communications standards such as DAB/DVB-T, 802.11 WLAN, 802.16 WMAN etc. The main impediment to the state-of-art of WLANs or WMANs for wireless access is their limited coverage. As is well known from mobile radio, cellular layouts can provide wide-area coverage for wireless communications via frequency reuse. However, requiring each access point (AP) or base station (BS) in such networks to be individually connected to the backbone (wired) network is not a feasible (cost-effective) solution to network scaling. Accordingly, there has been considerable interest in multi-hop architectures where the data to/from mobile user reaches the backbone network via multiple hops. This has two clear implications: while all APs or BS need not be wired to the backbone network (only a fraction of gateway APs or BSs are so connected), it requires some (future) protocol for inter-networking the APs or BSs. Our work is …","cites":"11","conferencePercentile":"67.76315789"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"54975bf8a6e53b7f6febbc478960105f05a9f1ed","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2012","title":"EasiRA: A hybrid rate adaptation scheme for 802.11 mobile wireless access networks","authors":"Tingpei Huang, Haiming Chen, Zhaoliang Zhang, Li Cui","author_ids":"3271489, 5546720, 2209216, 1759760","abstract":"—Rate adaptation, which adapts transmission bit rate according to current wireless link conditions, is a fundamental mechanism used by link-layer protocols to improve the performance of 802.11 wireless access networks in terms of throughput.

In this paper, we design a hybrid rate adaptation scheme, called EasiRA, for 802.11 mobile wireless access networks. It has following three features. First, it combines the sensor-hints and protocol-hints information together to estimate current link status. Second, EasiRA exploits environmental signal strength information obtained by a 802.15.4-based radio to help distinguish the causes of packet losses and adjust the thresholds of the protocol-hints.

I. INTRODUCTION With the continuous advances in wireless technologies, decreasing cost of electronics, and increased user demand for mobile data, it is the norm nowadays to find devices with multiple network interfaces. To keep up with this diversity in wireless technologies, devices such as laptops, netbooks, tablets, and various smart phones, are equipped with several network interfaces. Such devices, however, are currently incapable of fully leveraging these interfaces in order to enhance the overall system performance. Multiple interfaces can be simultaneously utilized by partitioning data across them in order to achieve higher throughput and enhance user experience. Many approaches have addressed the multiple interface bandwidth aggregation problem by proposing various solutions at different layers of the protocol stack. Application layer solutions typically require applications to be aware of the existence of multiple interfaces and be responsible for utilizing them [1]. Socket level solutions, on the other hand, modify the kernel socket handling functions to enable existing applications in order to use multiple interfaces [1], [2].

Our results in two different testbeds show that we can provide an accurate step count estimation with an error of 5.72%. In addition, our gait type classifier has an accuracy of 97.74%. This leads to a combined tracking error of 6.9% while depending only on the inertial sensors and turning off the GPS sensor completely.

Recently, the scheduling policy has been adapted in random medium access protocols such as CSMA/CA using prioritization of MAC layer transmissions. Here, MAC priorities are used to provide differentiated services to nodes depending on their queue backlogs. Even though these schemes work well in experiments to emulate back-pressure scheduling, they perform poorly with realistic Internet-type traffic where there is a large variation in packet sizes. In this paper, we propose packet aggregation based back-pressure scheduling which aggressively increases the rates at which back-logged queues are served. Different from other aggregation schemes, the presented scheme utilizes the back-pressure principles for determining when and how much aggregation is performed. We show that this results into increased service rates of back-logged queues which in turn results into high network throughput and utilization. We verify our scheme using simulations and testbed experiments, and show that it achieves significant performance improvements as compared to the original scheme. I. INTRODUCTION The back-pressure scheduling/routing policy first proposed by Tassiulas et al. [1] has recently shown a great potential for solving a number of issues in wireless multi-hop networks. The central idea of back-pressure scheduling policy is that contention among the links should be resolved by scheduling the link which has the largest product of queue differential backlog between its endpoints and transmission rate at which the link can be served. In a perfectly time-slotted medium access mechanism such as TDMA, this will result into optimal throughput of flows while guaranteeing queue stability (ingress traffic to a queue never exceeds its egress traffic). The utility maximization framework initially proposed in [2] shows that injection rates of flows should be chosen such that aggregate utility of the flows is maximized. Here the utility of flow represents a desirable effect on the network achieved by a particular rate of the flow. It was shown in [3]–[6] that back-pressure scheduling and utility based rate control together can solve the global problem of network utility maximization. The fundamental challenge with back-pressure framework is that solution of the underlying scheduling strategy is NP-hard [7]. Also, since it was proposed for a centralized, synchronized and time-slotted system, a distributed implementation which can achieve even a closer approximation is very difficult to develop.

Further, it is assumed that two nodes can communicate directly with one another if they are situated within R TX meters of one another. Otherwise, one or more intermediate nodes must function as datagram forwarders to support communications.

So we propose a temporal fair AQM－TFRED (Temporal Fair RED) on AP (Access Point) in multi-rate 802.11 WLAN.

Many existing rate adaptation mechanisms can dynamically switch data rates to match the channel conditions, with the goal of selecting the rate that will give the optimum throughput for the given channel conditions.

However, devices implementing different technologies may cause interference; this problem is well-documented as occurring with 802.11 (using DSSS) and Bluetooth (using FHSS). Designing an interference avoidance algorithm for combinations of these DSSS/FHSS based technologies is complex.

While several routing metrics have been proposed in the literature, it has been shown that link-quality aware metrics can provide significantly higher end-to-end throughput. To date, the online computation of such metrics requires the periodic transmission of probe packets at all available transmission rates. However, our link level measurement study on two different 802.11 testbeds demonstrates that: (a) multi-rate probe transmissions increase the number of collisions and enforce nodes to reside in the back-off state for prolonged time periods, and (b) the extent of performance degradation depends on the network density; a network-wide throughput reduction of the order of 400% is possible. In addition, our measurements show that the impact of probing in terms of end-to-end performance can be devastating. In particular, the probing functionality can pose a significant degradation in the end-to-end throughput of a single flow, by at least 35% and as high as 90%, depending on the probing frequency and network density. Finally, we discuss different alternatives to multi-rate probing for the online computation of such metrics. I. INTRODUCTION Discovering high-performance paths in multihop networks is challenging and has received a lot of attention during the last few years. Typically a routing protocol relies on a performance metric, in order for efficient paths to be discovered. As an example, AODV [1] and DSR [2] rely on the hop count metric; such protocols discover routes with the smallest number of intermediate hops. Recent studies have shown that shortest-path routing may not always be efficient; short routes may be comprised of a few, low-SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) links, and this can degrade performance due to the poor link quality [3] and the resulting use of low modulation data rates [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. As shown in [3], the PDR is a very accurate reflector of the link quality. Hence, modern routing protocols consider the PDR for estimating the quality of the individual links. In particular, such protocols try to find routes that consist of high-quality links [4], [5], [9]. In order to accomplish this, they compute the PDR of individual links using probe packets.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of neighbor discovery in low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks.

One of the problems in energy utilization is that nodes near the base station tend to die earlier than other nodes because of their higher traffic. This paper suggests an energy balanced chain (EBC) which can efficiently prolong the sensor network lifetime by actively controlling the nodes' hop distances. In EBC, we formulate the energy balance optimization problem in terms of the segmentation space.

However, in wireless ad hoc networks most interference comes from outside of this range. So, the effectiveness of IEEE 802.11 carrier sensing mechanism in ad hoc networks has attracted many studies. Prior research has attempted to evaluate effectiveness from a spatial viewpoint only, using an analytical model to estimate the size of the interference area of an ongoing communication based on the transmitter-receiver distance. Unlike this, the temporal effectiveness of the carrier sensing mechanism has been ignored. In this paper we propose an analysis combining spatial and temporal viewpoint to study the effect of interference on the performance of IEEE 802.11 protocol in ad hoc networks. We also compare the effectiveness of physical and virtual carrier sensing mechanisms, known as RTS/CTS mechanism, in wireless ad hoc networks. I. INTRODUCTION IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol [1] is the most popular standard used in wireless ad hoc networks. Its contention-based distributed coordination function (DCF) can support peer-to-peer communication for wireless ad hoc networks without centralized control of the channel access. In order to resolve the hidden station problem, request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) handshake is defined in DCF to reserve and announce the right of channel access, to avoid interference from hidden stations. However, RTS/CTS mechanism is designed mainly to support wireless local area networks (LANs) and not multihop wireless ad hoc networks [7]. The basic assumption of this mechanism is that all hidden stations are within the receiving range of a receiver, but this may not work when the transmitter-receiver distance grows so that some stations are outside this range [2]. Hence, RTS/CTS cannot work well in the latter scenario. Unfortunately, this scenario is common in wireless ad hoc networks because of wide distribution of mobile stations. Prior research attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of IEEE 802.11 MAC and physical protocol in wireless ad hoc networks through the spatial analytical model. In [2], the authors present a spatial model to describe the relation between transmission, carrier sensing, and interference range. They show that the effectiveness of RTS/CTS mechanism decreases gradually as the transmitter-receiver distance exceeds a threshold distance. In [3], a quantitative measure, the spatial reuse index, is introduced to evaluate the efficiency of the channel reservation by RTS/CTS method. Ref.

However, existing communities all require a central authority in form of a certificate authority or an authentication server. In this paper, we show how such a community network can be created without a central entity. We introduce a mechanism called remote station approval; a host can use it to offer Internet access without requiring a central instance and without the risk of legal responsibility for the guests' traffic. We discuss how our system preserves the anonymity of its users and present a prototype implementation and some first performance figures. I. INTRODUCTION The availability of broadband Internet connections in combination with flatrate pricing models and cheap WiFi hardware has made sharing this connectivity via WiFi an attractive solution for mobile Internet access. This approach has the potential to provide high bandwidths at low or even no deployment and usage costs. Access point (AP) sharing communities make use of this fact: a mobile user (called guest) may use the access point of another user (the host) at its current location to establish a connection to the Internet. are built around a central authority, the community operator. The operator manages user accounts, issues certificates, and is generally in charge of community membership. Consequently, all existing approaches require a host to trust the community operator when it comes to verifying the permission of guests to access the Internet. Because a guest could generate malicious traffic which would appear to originate from the host, making Internet access available to other people may incur certain risks for the host [18]. As a consequence, the commitment to trust the community operator when it comes to granting Internet access is problematic as it can have legal consequences. This may deter potential hosts from participating in the community. We therefore look at a system where the host himself can make an autonomous, safe decision whether access should be granted or not. Consequently, such a system does not need a central managing entity: it is a loose peer-to-peer community without formal membership, formed solely by de-facto participation and adherence to a set of open protocols. Obviously, such an approach contrasts with the quid pro quo principle of existing WiFi sharing systems which requires each member to provide Internet access to others in exchange for being allowed to use other APs.

Pathak, Rudra Dutta","author_ids":"2304251, 3050982","abstract":"—When shortest path routing is employed in large scale multi-hop wireless networks, nodes located near the center of the network have to perform disproportional amount of relaying for others. In energy-constrained networks like sensor, such unfair forwarding results into early depletion of batteries of these congested nodes. To solve the problem, various divergent routing schemes are used which route the data on center-avoiding divergent routing paths. Though they achieve better load balancing, overall relaying is increased significantly due to their longer routing paths which in turn results into reduced energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose power control as a way of achieving better load balancing in multi-hop wireless networks. We show that when communication range of nodes are properly controlled using power control, better load balancing can be achieved using shortest paths only. Such a strategy also decreases overall relaying in the network when compared to divergent routing schemes. We use the concept of centrality to achieve appropriate balance between relay burden of nodes and their power levels. Numerical results confirm that centrality based load balancing significantly improves network lifetime of sensor networks. I. INTRODUCTION Many of the routing protocols proposed for multi-hop wireless networks are based on shortest path routing (SPR) due to its characteristics like simplicity and robustness. When SPR is employed in a large scale multi-hop network, certain nodes based on their position and traffic pattern have to perform disproportional amount of relaying for others [1]. Such hot-spots are often created near the center in uniform topologies [2] and also at cluster peripheries in case of clustered topolo-gies. This increased congestion in certain areas has shown to be resulting into reduced network capacity. When the nodes are energy constrained, nodes performing higher amount of relaying than others deplete their batteries faster, reducing the overall network lifetime. As an example, when traffic flows between random source and destination pairs, network lifetime is often bounded by the lifetime of the nodes near the center since majority of the end-to-end shortest paths pass though them. On the other hand, when nodes send their data to a central entity (a sink or a gateway), generally one hop neighbors of the sink have to perform the most relaying which results into earlier depletion of their batteries [3], followed by disconnection of the sink from other alive nodes. In most cases, relay load distribution of nodes is significantly unfair where some nodes …","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"44.54545455"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"5f6c44ae223c2d82371a602bf0069ff99cb41169","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2012","title":"Cross ambiguity function based integer frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems","authors":"Danping Li, Yongzhao Li, Hailin Zhang, Lei Wang","author_ids":"7379349, 3207688, 1725068, 1743559","abstract":"—Using only one training symbol, a novel cross ambiguity function (CAF) based integer frequency offset (IFO) estima-tor for OFDM systems is proposed.

A coarse estimate of the sensors' locations is usually sufficient for many applications. An efficient Area Localization Scheme (ALS) has been proposed for large sensor networks. ALS is a range-free localization scheme that tries to estimate the position of a sensor within a certain area rather than its exact location. As the complex calculations are handled by the powerful sinks instead of the sensors, this reduces the energy consumed by the sensors and helps to extend the lifetime of the network. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of ALS using MICAz motes and the localization experiments carried out in both indoor and outdoor environments. We also propose algorithms and techniques to improve the accuracy of ALS in realistic deployment scenarios. We observed that the performance of ALS is comparable or better than other localization schemes that have been implemented while ALS has lower complexity and hardware requirements. I.

Sensor networks of the future are envisioned to revolutionize the paradigm of collecting and processing information in diverse environments. However, the severe energy constraints and limited computing resources of the sensors, present major challenges for such a vision to become a reality. We consider a network of energy–constrained sensors that are deployed over a region. Each sensor periodically produces information as it monitors its vicinity. The basic operation in such a network is the systematic gathering and transmission of sensed data to a base station for further processing. During data gathering, sensors have the ability to perform in–network aggregation (fusion) of data packets enroute to the base station. The lifetime of such a sensor system is the time during which we can gather information from all the sensors to the base station. A key challenge in data gathering is to maximize the system lifetime, given the energy constraints of the sensors. Given the location of sensors and the base station and the available energy at each sensor, we are interested in finding an efficient manner in which data should be collected from all the sensors and transmitted to the base station, such that the system lifetime is maximized. This is the maximum lifetime data gathering problem. In this paper, we describe a heuristic to solve the data gathering problem with aggregation in sensor networks.

For efficient congestion control, an accurate and timely estimation of resource demands by measuring the network congestion level is necessary. Unlike the wired networks, congestion level measurement in ad hoc networks is more difficult due to time-variant channel capacity, contention among neighboring nodes, and non-deterministic node scheduling. In this paper, we propose a new congestion detection mechanism that quantifies the congestion level accurately and energy-efficiently at both a node-level (implemented at the MAC layer) and a flow-level (implemented at the routing layer) in ad hoc networks. For accurate congestion measurement, a set of metrics that decouple the measurement from various MAC protocol characteristics is defined. For energy-efficient congestion measurement, an asynchronous channel loading measurement scheme called Lazy Measurement, which emulates synchronous measurement by using virtual channel sampling, is incorporated into the proposed scheme. Simulation results show the proposed mechanism significantly cut down the energy needed to accurately measure congestion while maintaining high level of accuracy needed for timely congestion control. I. INTRODUCTION Congestion in data networks happens when too many incoming packets are contending for limited shared resources such as queue buffers and outgoing bandwidth. During congestion , packets experience large delay or even get dropped due to queue overflow, resulting in throughput degradation. In ad hoc networks, congestion occurs as well whenever the incoming traffic volume exceeds available resources. Compared to wired network, however, we observe a much higher packet drop rate, which is caused by not only queue overflow, but also collisions at the receiving node(s). In addition, these packet drops have more adverse impact on ad hoc networks because the energy consumed to forward this packet from its source to the current location will be wasted. Energy in each node is the most scarce resource in ad hoc networks, and sometimes it may not be replenished. Hence, the fact that congestion in ad hoc networks is more likely to lead to packet drops and that these packet drops have a serious impact on energy efficiency, we must take remedial actions as soon as congestion rises before the problem deteriorates. A number of congestion-controlling solutions have been proposed in the literature [1], [2], [3].

To this end, this paper investigates the performance limits of wireless communication in HSRs scenario. Since the hybrid information transmitted between train and base station usually has diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements, QoS-based achievable rate region is utilized to characterize the transmission performance in this paper. It is proved that traditional ergodic capacity and outage capacity with unique QoS requirement can be regarded as two extreme cases of the achievable rate region proposed in this paper. The corresponding optimal power allocation strategy is also given to achieve the maximal boundary of achievable rate region.

A great deal of research in mobile and wireless networking over the past decade has examined ways of reducing energy usage, including specific techniques such as energy-aware protocols for routing and communication. However, to our knowledge, no systematic way has been developed for reasoning generally about the energy consumption of algorithms. Techniques to understand and reason about the time and space complexity of algorithms, in particular asymptotic analysis and the big-Oh notation, have helped place computer programming as well as system design on a firm theoretical and practical footing. Clearly a method for analyzing energy complexity at the same abstract algorithmic level would be invaluable. However, it is not clear that a uniform abstract model of energy complexity can be developed that is both theoretically tractable and has practical predictive ability. Minimizing energy consumption requires making tradeoffs between many resources, including computation, communication, and memory accesses; taking any single resource as a proxy for energy cost neglects these tradeoffs and may lead to a poor model. In this paper we survey techniques for modeling and minimizing energy consumption at various system levels, so as to place algorithmic energy complexity in perspective. We then discuss the attributes that a model of energy complexity should have, and describe our initial approach towards developing such a model.

Deploying directional antennas to wireless networks can reduce interference among concurrent transmissions and increase spatial reuse, while the technology of multi-channel can separate concurrent transmissions. Therefore, combining these two technologies into one wireless network is capable of great improvement on the network capacity. Recent studies proposed a multi-channel network architecture that equips each wireless node with multiple directional antennas, which is called MC-MDA network. The capacity in MC-MDA network is derived under arbitrary and random placements. However, they only used a simplified directional antenna model. For approaching the more accurate capacity in real scenario, in this paper, we consider a hybrid antenna model, which takes the effect of side lobe and back lobe into account. We derive the capacity upper-bounds of MC-MDA networks in arbitrary and random network with the hybrid model to find the effect of back lobe and side lobe. We show that the network capacity is closely related to s the ratio of the radiuses of side lobe to main lobe. The capacity decreases when s increases. Moreover, we compare the network capacity of MC-MDA using the simplified antenna model with our results. When considering the factor of interference constraint, the capacity gain using the hybrid antenna model is θ 2 θ 2 +(4π 2 −θ 2)s over the one with the simplified model. I.

In recent years, a great number of works reported on the multi-channel networks and the application of directional antennas. A node equipped with multiple network interfaces can proceed multiple simultaneous transmissions and receptions in multiple channels. The analytical results in [2] discovered that the capacity of multi-channel networks have different bounds depending on the ratio of the number of interfaces m to channels c.

Unlike previous techniques, the choice of neighbors in the broadcast and multicast trees in these schemes, are based not only on the link distance, but also on the error rates associated with the link. Our work is based on some existing techniques that create such trees which have a constant approximation ratio to optimal solutions. However, these existing techniques are applicable only to the ideal scenario where wireless links are error-free. Through simulations we show that our scheme achieves upto 45% improvement over previous schemes on realistic 100-node network topolo-gies. I. INTRODUCTION Algorithms to create energy-efficient broadcast or multicast trees in multi-hop wireless networks aim to exploit the inherent wireless broadcast advantage: when omnidirectional antennas are used, every transmission by a transmitting node can be received by all nodes within the transmission range. The problem of determining minimum aggregate transmission energy trees is known to be NP-Hard for the broadcast case [5]. Computation of similar minimum energy multicast trees in wired environments is equivalent to the Steiner tree problem, which is also known to be NP-Hard. Therefore, intelligent heuristic algorithms have been proposed for constructing such minimum-energy broadcast or multicast trees [5], [10]. All these algorithms , however, aim to minimize the transmission power required by a sender and intermediate nodes for a single packet transmission — they do not consider how possible link errors affect the energy costs for reliable delivery of the packet to the entire set of destination nodes. In this paper, we focus on developing energy-efficient trees for reliable wireless multicasting or broadcasting. In wireless environments, where individual links often have high error rates, such reliable delivery potentially requires one or more re-transmissions. Currently known minimum-energy tree formation algorithms assign costs to links based purely on the energy spent in a single transmission attempt to reach all their children. These techniques, therefore, do not provide the best performance from a reliable delivery standpoint. Since the number of retransmissions needed by a node to reliably deliver a packet to its children clearly depends on the error rates of the associated links, a retransmission-aware minimum cost algorithm must assign costs based on two parameters — the transmission power required by the node to reach its children on the delivery tree and the error probability of its outgoing links.

We have studied the energy efficiency of two different error correction mechanisms and have measured the efficiency of an implementation in software. We will show that it is not sufficient to concentrate on the energy efficiency of error control mechanisms only, but the required extra energy consumed by the wireless interface should be incorporated as well. A model is presented that can be used to determine an energy-efficient error-correction scheme of a minimal system consisting of a general-purpose processor and a wireless interface. As an example we have determined these error-correction parameters on two systems with a WaveLAN interface. I INTRODUCTION Low energy consumption is a key issue for portable wireless network devices like computers like PDAs and laptops where battery energy is a limited resource. Power consumption is becoming the limiting factor in the amount of functionality that can be placed in these devices [8]. More extensive and continuous use of network services will only aggravate this problem [21]. Since high error rates are inevitable to the wireless environment, energy-efficient error control is an important issue for mobile computing systems. This includes energy spent in the physical radio transmission process, as well as energy spent in computation, including error coding. This paper describes how energy efficiency in the wireless link can be enhanced via adaptive error control and we investigate the energy efficiency of error control mechanisms. The focus is on the higher protocol layers (link and transport) layers that offer a high potential gain of energy efficiency. Error-control mechanisms traditionally trades off complexity and buffering requirements for throughput and delay [13][14][2]. In our approach we apply energy consumption constraints to the error control mechanisms in order to enhance energy efficiency under various wireless channel conditions. In a wireless environment these conditions not only vary dynamically because the physical conditions of a communication system can vary rapidly, but they can also vary because the user moves from an indoor office environment to a crowded city town. Not only the characteristics could have changed, it is even possible that a complete different infrastructure will be used [20]. The communication interface of the mobile must not only be able to adapt to these situations and provide the basic functionally, it must also do it energy efficient in all these situations.

INTRODUCTION Sensor networks [1] — networks of tiny nodes equipped with limited sensing, computing, and radio communication capabilities — are a technological vision that is currently receiving a lot of attention from several research communities. In a typical scenario, such sensor networks would use wireless communication to transmit their observation values to a given monitor station which would serve as a user interface. A joint characteristic of most application scenarios is that sensors only have a limited energy supply which might not even be rechargeable, hence they have to work as energy-efficiently as possible. One option is to reduce transmission power using intermediate nodes as relays instead of direct communication with a remote node. While such relaying has its own disadvantages (energy is now also consumed for intermediate reception and transmission), relaying can be beneficial for improving energy efficiency [2]. Yet arbitrarily reducing transmission power is not possible ; at least, some direct neighbors of a sensor node must be reachable to provide the possibilities to perform relaying and to form a connected network via relaying. Therefore it is important to find algorithms which determine appropriate transmission power levels for every node. In addition, because of the size and dynamics of sensor networks, these algorithms should be distributed ones, relying only on locally available information and therewith being scalable as the network growths. We present two distributed (local) algorithms that determine an individual transmission power level for each node of a fixed, non-mobile wireless sensor network.

In this paper, we consider the multicast case and derive a different conclusion: namely, it pays to exploit unidirectional links rather then avoid them. To prove the point, we select a popular ad hoc multicast protocol, On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) and introduce a slightly modified version, ODMRP-ASYM, that can handle unidirectional links. Specifically, ODMRP-ASYM reroutes the Join Reply packet when a unidirectional link is detected on the Join Query path. The option is invoked only when a unidirectional link is detected. The main advantages are: control overhead comparable with ODMRP even in highly asymmetric topologies; virtually no performance degradation in presence of unidirectional links (while ODMRP typically suffers up to 15% drop in delivery performance), and; 2-connectivity maintenance even if no bidirectional path exists between sender and receiver (in this case, unidirectional link avoidance strategies fail).

This admission control scheme is based on a differential bandwidth reservation policy that uses a sector of cells in making bandwidth reservation for accepting the new call. The sector of cells, which are located along the way to which the MT might move, are further divided into two regions depending on whether they have an immediate impact on the handoff or not. Two different bandwidth reservation policies are applied to cells in the two regions to optimize the connection dropping rate (CDR) while maximizing the connection blocking rate (CBR). In contrast to most prior policies, the proposed admission control scheme uses varying number of cells in the sector to make admission decision. Depending on the currently measured average CDR of the cells in the sector and the current cell where a new connection is generated, the number of cells involved in admission control can be changed dynamically to satisfy the target QoS (CDR) parameter. Simulation results indicate that our admission control policy guarantees the required CDR over the entire workload, while maintaining a competitive CBR.

This is due to a protocol property which tries to provide equal probability of channel access to all nodes. But in multi-hop ad hoc network a more frequent channel access might be necessary at certain nodes that are intermediate hops and forward other nodes' data. We propose a modification to the protocol that leads to a higher throughput and lower delay by combining the ACK for one packet with the channel access procedure for another, queued-to-be-sent packet. Hence, nodes receiving many packets, probably forwarder, have a higher chance of accessing the channel. Additionally, these changes provide a scheme of packet forwarding more robust to different layouts than original IEEE 802.11, where performance can heavily deteriorate in certain configurations. I. INTRODUCTION The most widely used wireless communication protocol for computer networks is the group of IEEE 802.11 standards. This standard has different modes of operation; for ad hoc networks , the distributed coordination function (DCF) along with its request to send (RTS)/clear to send (CTS) [1] handshake is the mode of choice. With this handshake the collisions due to the hidden terminal effect can be reduced, but it requires additional bandwidth for the transmission of the RTS and CTS frames, which are solely used for the handshake. As this mechanism was developed with one-hop data transfers in mind, it was a later finding that MAC protocols utilizing this mechanism perform poorly in ad hoc multi-hop networks. In simple scenarios such as chain or lattice networks, the achieved throughput is about 40 % below [2] the theoretically achievable one [3]. To improve throughput and latency for a chain of hops in the DCF, Acharya et. al. proposed the Data-driven Cut-through Medium Access protocol (DCMA) [4], which needs additional labels in each packet to mark the flow it belongs too. This protocol merges the acknowledgment (ACK) for a packet reception for one hop with an RTS for the same packet's transmission over the next hop. Thus, the implicit right to send an ACK is exploited to reserve the channel for the next hop, combining two channel accesses into one single \" cut-through \" access. To identify a forwarding packet of a flow, a special label is added. A network interface card (NIC) can then quickly","cites":"16","conferencePercentile":"77.69784173"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"21446db32861aa6b38350c6b875c3e9b3efde2b2","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2000","title":"AODV-BR: backup routing in ad hoc networks","authors":"Sung-Ju Lee, Mario Gerla","author_ids":"5273011, 8467438","abstract":"– Nodes in mobile ad hoc networks communicate with one another via packet radios on wireless multihop links.

However, wireless network standards typically focus on MAC layer and physical layer signaling, leaving crucial end to end delay and security issues to application implementers. Delay and security provisioning issues in such an environment is very challenging. In this paper, we address an integrated solution to end-to-end delay and security, where the middleware adaptation provides tunable delay and security support according to network condition. The test-bed experiments show that the proposed solution successfully adjusts multimedia applications to meet both delay and security requirements in IEEE 802.11-based wireless environment. For a high-quality, smoothly displayed conversational mul-timedia applications, e.g., VoIP, video phone, the data are required to be delivered from the source to a destination within a certain amount of delay. It means multimedia flows are usually data-intensive and time-sensitive with end-to-end delay being critical. However, end to end delay support in 802.11 wireless networks is very challenging, since the bandwidth of a wireless link is limited, shared, unpredictable, and the channel capacities and error rates are time-varying in comparison with wired networks. On the other hand, QoS is not the only issue to handle when VoIP services is deployed over 802.11 links. The main aspects of security include privacy of voice and the protection of unauthorized consumption of multimedia service. How to balance QoS and security is a big concern. Many researches address the QoS issue in wireless networks. [1], [2], [3] provide end-to-end QoS support by adapting traditional QoS model for wireless networks. These approaches use per-application admissions, which cause poor scalability and suffer from improper admission control due to the time varying characteristics of the highly dynamic wireless environments. Current research on developing QoS support for wireless networks is mostly focused at the MAC layer. [4], [5], [6] study the MAC layer scheduling under IEEE 802.11 DCF to provide differentiated delays. However, the MAC layer solutions are not appropriated to support end-to-end application-specific QoS requirements.

TCP's implicit AIMD flow control performs poorly in this environment, because it often cannot keep up with the dynamics of the network. In this paper, we explore the potential utility of explicit flow control in the MANET domain. To this end, we propose an end-to-end rate-based flow control scheme (called EXACT), where a flow's allowed rate is explicitly conveyed from intermediate routers to the end-hosts in each data packet's special control header. As a result, EXACT reacts quickly and precisely to rerouting and bandwidth variation, which makes it especially suitable for a dynamic MANET network. We also discuss several supporting mechanisms required for such a scheme at the MAC and the transport layers. By ns-2 simulations, we show that EXACT outperforms TCP in terms of fairness and efficiency, especially in a highly dynamic MANET environment. I. INTRODUCTION Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is formed by a group of mobile nodes connected by wireless links. The nodes can talk to each other by direct peer-to-peer wireless communication when they are close to each other, or by multi-hop forwarding via intermediate nodes when they are far away. As in wireline networks, end-host in MANET must face the non-trivial problem of deciding how fast it can send packets to a destination over the network. This is the flow control (or congestion control) problem in networking research. Generally, a flow control scheme has two goals [1]: efficiency and fairness. Efficiency refers to the property that the aggregated traffic at the bottleneck router should match the available bandwidth of the outgoing links. Fairness refers to the property that each competing flow should get its \" fair \" share of the available bandwidth. Over the Internet, TCP's AIMD (Additive Increase Multi-plicative Decrease) is the predominant flow control algorithm. It belongs to the implicit flow control category, because it measures the network congestion state by performance measurements at the end-hosts (i.e., packet loss), without any help from the network. Due to TCP's wide acceptance and software availability over the Internet, it remains the current de facto flow control standard in MANET as well. However, recent studies have shown that TCP suffers fairness and efficiency problems in this environment (e.g., [2]–[5]). We summarize these problems as follows.

Well-defined effective metrics to identify the potential vulnerability in advance are essential for failure prevention. We propose a novel and advantageous metric called Battery Index to predict energy-vulnerable nodes at the very early stage of the network lifetime. Enabled by this metric, two proactive schemes are designed to prolong the lifetime of randomly deployed WSNs through dynamic routing and load balancing, and mobile robot-based node rescue, respectively. The proposed metric and schemes are validated through simulations employing realistic models, and numerical results show significant improvement in network lifetime (or usability) and resilience. I. INTRODUCTION Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are inherently fault prone and vulnerable mainly due to battery depletion, link failure and congestion [1]. Fault (or failure) management is therefore essential to maintain the healthy operation of a WSN. Generally, fault-tolerant schemes can be classified into two categories: reactive or proactive. A reactive scheme is designed to react to a failure that has occurred and to recover from that failure, whilst a proactive one attempts to detect a potential failure in advance and to \" prevent \" (or actually postpone) it. Typically, the proactive approach is more attractive since failure prevention tends to be more effective to avoid performance deterioration. Nevertheless, a proactive scheme usually demands more intelligence and could incur more overheads. Despite the differences, both approaches would normally need well-defined metrics to identify the failure and then trigger the corresponding recovery or prevention procedure. Battery depletion is the most common cause for node failures in energy-constrained WSNs. Traditionally, the Residual Battery metric is used to monitor energy consumption. For example [2] and [3] propose accurate energy models based on emulation of the sensor node's hardware in order to calculate energy spent and thus estimate the Residual Battery. However, the values of this metric have little meanings unless they can be collected and compared with each other.

Wong","author_ids":"1705796, 2018159","abstract":"— In this paper, we present a low complexity turbo equalization receiver for data transmission over time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. In the receiver, a fixed-lag Kalman equalizer jointly estimates the channel and equalizes the data symbols with the assistance of a priori information supplied by the decoder. The complexity of the proposed equalizer does not grow exponentially with the modulation constellation size, and is usually lower than that of many maximum a posteriori equalizers performing joint channel estimation and detection. Performance comparison with different types of turbo equalizers demonstrates the advantage of the proposed turbo equalizer. I. INTRODUCTION Turbo equalization, as a powerful suboptimal technique, is originally proposed for coded systems with intersymbol interference (ISI) in [1]. By combining a maximum a posteriori (MAP) equalizer [2] with a MAP decoder, and exchanging probabilistic information about data symbols iteratively, turbo equalization usually can achieve close-to-optimal performance but with much lower complexity [1], [3]. Lately, a variety of soft-in soft-out (SISO) turbo equalizers employing linear MMSE and decision feedback equalization techniques are proposed in [5] to further reduce the complexity. For the scenario of an unknown time-varying channel, it is necessary to perform channel estimation (explicitly or implicitly) at the receiver with the aid of pilot symbols to provide channel knowledge for the equalizer or detector. To take advantage of turbo equalization, the channel estimator can utilize the a posteriori decision on data symbols obtained from previous iterations as training information and perform multiple iterations to enhance the channel tracking capability. A simple and widely used approach to exploit this scheme is to perform channel estimation and equalization separately in each iteration [4], [6]– [8]. In these works, linear channel estimators employing least mean squares (LMS), recursive least squares (RLS) and Kalman filtering (KF) are developed in the iterative context. This class of schemes with LMS or RLS channel estimation usually work well only for slow fading channels. A better approach of combining estimation and equalization for faster fading channels is to embed channel estimation into the data detection process. This results in the adaptive soft-in soft-out (A-SISO) detection techniques suggested in [9], [10]. Based on the A-SISO detection techniques , Ref. [11] proposes an iterative Bayesian expectation maximization detector by embedding a Kalman estimator into the MAP detector.

We also demonstrate, however, that extremely robust performance can be obtained by employing multiple antennas at appropriately chosen separations, using standard space-time communications strategies such as transmit precoding (when the transmitter knows the channel) and space-time coding (when the transmitter does not know the channel).","cites":"26","conferencePercentile":"98.78787879"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"0057722c8a2819dc173ca8bbf41fd821109d8148","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2005","title":"Optimal and suboptimal finger selection algorithms for MMSE RAKE receivers in impulse radio ultra-wideband systems","authors":"Sinan Gezici, Mung Chiang, H.

Current power-adaptive approaches proposed for broadcasting, can be grouped into a) centralized or omniscient schemes, and b) decentralized or localized schemes. The latter assume only local neighborhood information. Due to the absence of global information, localized algorithms may not produce optimal or near-optimal solutions. On the other hand, global knowledge is not typically available to nodes and may be extremely expensive to disseminate. In this paper, we examine the importance of the lack of global information on the performance of localized approaches. Towards this, we perform extensive simulations and compare the performance of localized power adaptive broadcasting with the performance of the well-known Broadcast Incremental Power or BIP, an omniscient algorithm. We analyze the behaviors of the two protocols and identify the reasons for the differences in behavior. We observe that while global state does provide better performance in terms of energy efficiency, the localized scheme outperforms the global scheme in terms of the latency incurred in the broadcast. Based on the observed behavioral traits of the two protocols, we suggest changes by which the energy consumption with the localized scheme is reduced by as much as 20%, while incurring almost no penalty in terms of latency.","cites":"6","conferencePercentile":"51.31578947"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"34f9c0a65fbbec1adab93d061dd4ee8aefca1134","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2007","title":"Event Region for Effective Distributed Acoustic Source Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","authors":"Youngbin You, Jaehyun Yoo, Hojung Cha","author_ids":"2396339, 8351817, 1694711","abstract":"—Compared to a centralized system for acoustic source localization using WSN, a distributed system has many advantages in terms of scalability, power consumption, and response time.

This results in two different algorithms dealing with each timescale: the resource optimizer optimize the sum of utilities in the slowly changed time scale, and the slot sched-uler exploits the ef£ciency in the highly variable time scale.

INTRODUCTION It is a challenging task for wireless networks to allocate wireless resources to meet the requirement of certain quality of service (QoS) as well as to gain high radio frequency utilization over the shared, scarce and time-varying wireless channel. Resource allocation schemes and scheduling policies are critical to achieve these goals. There have been numerous successful works developing elaborate scheduling algorithms in wireline networks (see [1], [2] and therein) in order to provide certain service performance guarantees. Unfortunately, those schemes can't be deployed directly in the wireless environment because of the unique characteristics of the wireless channel: £rst, the wireless channel is error-prone, and errors are location-dependant and time-varying; second, wireless links are susceptible to air interference and the capacity loss is unavoidable. There have been several pieces of works (see [3] and therein) to deal with such problems. In [4], [5] and [6], authors provide their modi£ed wireless version of fair queueing algorithms based on the idealized Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) policy. These algorithms inherit the advantage of the ones in wireline networks, such as short term and long term fairness, as well as short term and long term throughput bounds. However , they oversimplify the channel conditions by modelling the wireless channel as either \" good \" or \" bad \" , so that the channel capacity might be under-utilized, especially when some adap-tive techniques [7] can be used.

A variety of protocols have been proposed in order to ensure secure data delivery across these systems; however, the majority of these schemes assume the presence of public or pre-established symmetric keys. Accordingly, the cost of key management has not been incorporated into secure routing mechanisms in this setting. This paper considers the expenses incurred by sensor networks implementing secure routing schemes on top of probabilistic symmetric key management schemes. Specifically, we examine the overhead observed from proactive and reactive key establishment mechanisms for networks using a balanced method of key management. Through extensive simulation, we quantify more realistic costs for the application of secure hop-by-hop routing in sensor networks. I. INTRODUCTION Wireless sensor networks are rapidly becoming invaluable tools for the distributed aggregation and processing of data. From monitoring inventory and environmental conditions to vehicle tracking, these systems allow their administrators to observe remote and or dangerous locations in a cost-effective fashion. One of the most important challenges facing sensor networks is that of secure data dissemination. The focus of a large pool of literature in recent years, secure data dissemination is absolutely essential to network fidelity as nodes are completely reliant upon their neighbors to forward packets to their intended destinations. In a setting where individuals must be skeptical of the activities of their neighbors, simply trusting that an adjacent node is performing the expected operations on our data would be na¨ıve. Providing security for wireless sensor networks is a particularly difficult task. Whereas nodes in wired networks are able to leverage considerable resources in terms of power, processing ability and positive human/administrator interaction along with centralized, trusted servers, sensor nodes typically lack all of the aforementioned means. Accordingly, security solutions for sensor networks must typically be distributed, robust and as efficient as possible. While a number of schemes have been suggested to make the interactions between neighbors more secure in MANETs, the majority of works have failed to truly translate to a sensor network environment as the key management strategies implemented by those methods are infeasible in this setting.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"48.56115108"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"d68920794dde9ea7b9e85cac044c5ea22c1e88ae","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2013","title":"Energy-efficient uplink training design for closed-loop MISO systems","authors":"Xin Liu, Shengqian Han, Chenyang Yang, Chengjun Sun","author_ids":"1749705, 1679228, 8100489, 5197694","abstract":"—When the circuit power consumption and the overhead for channel estimation are taken into account, the system designed for maximizing the spectrum efficiency (SE) does not necessarily yield high energy efficiency (EE).

Several routing protocols have been proposed for wireless ad-hoc networks. Most of these protocols, however, presuppose the presence of bi-directional links between the nodes in the network. In reality the ad-hoc network may consist of heterogeneous nodes with different power capabilities and hence, different transmission ranges. When this is the case, a given node might be able to receive the transmission of another given node but might not be able to successfully transmit to the latter. Thus, unidirectional links are formed. Most of the current routing protocols are unsuitable for deployment when such unidirectional links are present. We consider a routing protocol called the zone routing protocol (ZRP) that has been proposed for wireless ad-hoc networks with bi-directional links. The zone routing protocol employs a hybrid proactive (table driven) and reactive (on-demand) methodology to provide scalable routing in the ad-hoc network. However, in the presence of unidirectional links some routes remain undiscovered if ZRP is used. We propose extensions to ZRP to support its deployment when unidirectional links are present. In particular, we propose a query enhancement mechanism that recursively builds partial routes to a destination. Simulation results show that even at a high mobility of 20m/s, t he queries resulting due to the enhancement mechanism result in the computation of valid routes more than 80% of the time. These results are valid even when a large number (40% of nodes have half the transmission range as that of the remaining nodes) of unidirectional links are present in the network.","cites":"30","conferencePercentile":"84.67741935"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"41592aab8928ffa1f14f59c346e2b4c2b5dcbeec","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2008","title":"A Stochastic Model for Misbehaving Relays in Cooperative Diversity","authors":"Sintayehu Dehnie, Nasir D. Memon","author_ids":"1821167, 1719861","abstract":"—Existing cooperative diversity protocols are designed with the inherent assumption that users exhibit cooperative behavior all the time. However, in a practical cooperative wireless system users may misbehave in malicious or selfish manner. Thus existing cooperative diversity protocols are inherently vulnerable to misbehaving users as they lack a mechanism to detect the presence of such users. In this paper we examine the physical layer consequences of a malicious user which exhibits cooperative behavior in a stochastic manner. We assume that the malicious user exploits the inherent uncertainty of the wireless channel to hide its malicious behavior. We consider a malicious user which exhibits cooperative and malicious behaviors according to first-order Markov chain. By behaving stochastically the malicious user attempts to mimic the underlying Markov property of Rayleigh fading channels. Based on this model we examine physical layer performance of cooperative Detect-and-Forward (DF). We show that a malicious user incurs significant degradation in cooperative diversity gain. Our results indicate that misbehaving users may pose formidable challenge to practical implementation of cooperative diversity. Hence, it may be difficult to implement practical wireless cooperative networks without a mechanism to ensure cooperation.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"8.415841584"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"3e16f730421be4d2e4c8db9009953b1aa79fdad4","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2008","title":"Bluetooth 2.1 based Emergency Data Delivery System in HealthNet","authors":"Seung-Hoon Lee, Sewook Jung, Alexander Chang, Dae-Ki Cho, Mario Gerla","author_ids":"1798805, 2985929, 3962678, 1797221, 8467438","abstract":"—The interests in health care have considerably increased these days as the aging population becomes larger. Health care has grown to the one of most active research areas especially in the area of wireless, mobile health monitoring systems. The wireless network technologies have advanced to the point where they can enable and help deploy a very broad gamut of systems suitable for medical applications. Several researches have proposed to replace the wired connections among medical devices with wireless connections. Wireless network technologies interwork with sensor equipped Body LANs. Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) are well positioned to support Health Care applications in limited geographic areas. In particular, the characteristics of Bluetooth and its popularity make it the preferred network infrastructure for HealthNet environments. However, Bluetooth has the \" bad reputation \" of long connection delays, which may be disastrous in some health applications. In this paper we address the connection delay and propose a new data transfer protocol based on Bluetooth version 2.1. The 2.1 version was published very recently and offers new features that are interest to our application. Among the new features we leverage EIR and SSP to solve the delay problem. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed system significantly improves data delivery as well as power consumption. It solves a well known problem in Bluetooth based wireless networks. Using our proposed scheme, Bluetooth devices are now adequate to support sophisticated scenarios such as emergencies and urgent data dissemination requirements.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"26.23762376"},{"venue":"WCNC","id":"aed0160288982af94c3be85a5d517221bf8a1d40","venue_1":"WCNC","year":"2014","title":"Performance of visible light communications with dimming controls","authors":"Zi Feng, George Papageorgiou, Qian Gao, Ahmed Osama Fathy Atya, Srikanth V.

However, the design and deployment of a VLC system requires an understanding of the underlying communications and how they affect the design of higher layer protocols. In this paper, we take a basic step towards getting an understanding of the impact of interference on a VLC system. Such an understanding is key to the design of MAC protocols for arbitrating access across lights in multiple rooms, while ensuring that illumination requirements are met. Specifically, we consider the interference across two rooms from VLC emitters. The emitters are assumed to use Binary Pulse Position Modulation (BPPM); the pulse width is varied to provide different dimming levels. In this setting, we use a modified ray-tracing algorithm to calculate the channel impulse response between the emitters and receivers that are located at different positions within a room. Subsequently, we analyze the performance observed at the receivers in the presence of (i) illumination and (ii) transmissions from an interfering VLC emitter. We find that in the former case, the VLC emissions from the interferer do not impact the reception at the target receiver. However, in the latter case, the performance is degraded. The extent of degradation depends on the position of the receiver. We find that increasing the dimming level increases the pulse intensity and thus, improves performance in the presence of interference. We also perform extensive simulations to provide performance results in different settings.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"21.64179104"}]}
