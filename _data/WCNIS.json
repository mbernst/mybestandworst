The proposal is based on an identity-based cryptographic approach that offers an independent setup of security domains and does not require a trust hierarchy compared to other identity-based cryptographic systems. The service URLs can be used as public keys, such that creating a secure connection to a service is very simple. A comparison between traditional approaches and identity-based cryptography with respect to data transfer requirements is presented. I. INTRODUCTION The Grid computing paradigm offers unified access to heterogeneous compute and storage resources in a shared use environment. To facilitate Grid usage, a large number of supporting services, such as authentication, authorization, file staging, virtual organization management, and (meta-) scheduling, are offered by the widespread Globus GT4 mid-dleware or by software systems, such as the GridWay meta-scheduler or VOMS for virtual organization management. One of the main points of critique leveled against the Grid is the complexity of installing and securing custom applications. Much of this complexity stems from the multi-administrator, shared use, heterogeneous nature of the Grid and the highly diverse requirements Grid users have. For a detailed discussion of these problems, the reader is referred to Smith et al. [12]. The emerging Cloud computing paradigm, as pioneered by Amazon, offers simple and quick access to compute and storage resources offered by a single provider. Users may access resources on-demand and in a pay-per-use manner through simple interfaces like web services, without knowledge or control of the technology and the infrastructure used by the provider. Application areas include: application hosting, backup and storage, content delivery, and computing resources. These application areas differ from Grid computing where the main focus lies on high performance computing and data storage. One of the major advances of Cloud computing over Grid computing is the use of a fully virtualized infrastructure, which significantly eases the installation and maintenance of custom applications. This also solves many of the shared use","cites":"6","conferencePercentile":"97.36842105"},{"venue":"WCNIS","id":"d85859c6ee56d4b7e9336dc43eed2107ecb0ef7f","venue_1":"WCNIS","year":"2010","title":"Behavior profiling for robust anomaly detection","authors":"Shun-Wen Hsiao, Yeali S.

Conventional detection systems using signature-based and/or rule-based anomaly detection techniques no longer suffice. It is difficult to predict what form the next malware attack will take and these pose a great challenge to the design of a robust intrusion detection system. We focus on the anomalous behavioral characteristics between attack and victim when they undergo sequences of compromising actions and that are inherent to the classes of vulnerability-exploit attacks. A new approach, Ges-talt, is proposed to statefully capture and monitor activities between hosts and progressively assess possible network anomalies by multilevel behavior tracking, cross-level triggering and correlation, and a probabilistic inference model is proposed for intrusion assessment and detection. Such multilevel design provides a collective perspective to reveal more anomalies than individual levels. We show that Gestalt is robust and effective in detecting polymorphic, stealthy variants of known attacks.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"31.57894737"},{"venue":"WCNIS","id":"1859c9ff87fb83cdf8ad19a39bf7f94a4d9b2173","venue_1":"WCNIS","year":"2010","title":"An attack-resilient Grid auditing infrastructure","authors":"Christopher Kunz, Jan Wiebelitz, Matthew Smith","author_ids":"2429772, 2648118, 1767286","abstract":"As recent experiments have shown, current Grid infras­ tructures are highly vulnerable against root exploits. In these attacks legitimate Grid user credentials were used to compromise vulnerable Grid head and worker nodes. Any such attack against a distributed working environment is critical. However, in the Grid it is particularly devastating, attacks against the head node affect unencrypted Grid proxy certificates. Using these, an attacker can act with the permissions of the original owner, undermining the Grid security concept. Even after the original attack has been detected and the affected systems have been sanitized, the attacker is still in possession of the stolen proxy. In previous work we introduced an auditing infrastructure that gives Grid users a way to reconstruct usage of their delegated credentials and detect their possibly abuse. We achieve this by including an X.S09 certificate extension in a proxy credential signed by the Grid user � making the users request to track credential usage tamper-proof In this paper, we extend the auditing infrastructure by a novel encryption aware watchdog, which can detect proxy certificate misuse even in the face of complete root compromise of all accessible Grid resources. It correlates network communication in the Grid with the auditing infrastructure and can thus detect proxy certificate misuse and tampering with the auditing framework.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"78.94736842"}]}
