Due to the many applications and data types, there is no standard email format. Therefore, much current work in the forensic investigation of emails has focused on data extraction. This paper focuses on the investigatory process and posits a model for social network discovery for use in digital investigations. This model is applied to the widely used Enron email corpus to demonstrate its applicability.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"39.28571429"}]}
