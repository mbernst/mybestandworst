In humanities the focus has often been on describing the content of collections and expressing datasets so that they can be linked, thus improving discovery and facilitating research. This paper suggests that descriptions of processes are also useful, be they historical processes or the process of scholarship itself , and therefore worthy of attention at the intersection of semantic web and digital scholarship. We explore this through an exercise in describing the provenance of a 'born digital' and a historical artefact.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"35"}]}
