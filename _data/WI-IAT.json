One key aspect of a successful negotiating agent is its ability to make appropriate concessions at the right time, especially when there are costs associated with the duration of the negotiation. However, so far, there is no fundamental approach on how much to concede at every stage of the negotiation in such time-sensitive domains. We introduce an efficient solution based on simultaneous search, which is able to select the optimal sequence of offers that maximizes expected payoff, given the agent's beliefs about the opponent. To this end, we show that our approach is consistent with known theoretical results and we demonstrate both its effectiveness and natural properties by applying it to a number of typical negotiation scenarios. Finally, we show in a number of experiments that our solution outperforms other state of the art strategy benchmarks.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"33.33333333"},{"venue":"WI-IAT","id":"4816b25434e353716eeb3502c7755f1b7b74ba37","venue_1":"WI-IAT","year":"2014","title":"Semantic Similarity Measurements for Multi-lingual Short Texts Using Wikipedia","authors":"Tatsuya Nakamura, Masumi Shirakawa, Takahiro Hara, Shojiro Nishio","author_ids":"2027905, 2657265, 1697569, 1717916","abstract":"In this paper, we propose two methods to measure the semantic similarity for multi-lingual and short texts by using Wikipedia. In recent years, people around the world have been continuously generating information about their local area in their own languages on social networking services. Measuring the similarity between the texts is challenging because they are often short and written in various languages. Our methods solve this problem by incorporating inter-language links of Wikipedia into extended naive Bayes (ENB), a probabilistic method of semantic similarity measurements for short texts. The proposed methods represent a multi-lingual short text as a vector of the English version of Wikipedia articles (entities). We conducted an experiment on clustering of tweets written in four languages (English, Spanish, Japanese and Arabic). From the experimental results, we confirmed that our methods outperformed cross-lingual explicit semantic analysis (CL-ESA), which is a method to measure the similarity between texts written in two different languages. Moreover, our methods were competitive with ENB applied to texts that have been translated into English using Google Translate. Our methods enabled similarity measurements for multi-lingual short texts without the cost of machine translations.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"76.96335079"},{"venue":"WI-IAT","id":"9bcbca6927d4a222f2e5b7defba6a919ca1139cd","venue_1":"WI-IAT","year":"2014","title":"Uncertainty Reasoning Based Formal Framework for Big Video Data Understanding","authors":"Shuwei Chen, Kathy M.

This approach constructs the hierarchical representation structure based on the semantic understanding of considered scenario, and transforms the structure into logic formulas.

In order to discover various conceptualized relations, we focus on Web-scale text corpora and introduce a simple string-matching method to process them. To derive relations between concepts, our method first extracts relations between terms and next replaces each term by appropriate concepts using Wikipedia, Word Net, and YAGO knowledge. We extracted over 10 million relations between concepts in a day from more than 10TB of Web texts using 100 machines. Experimental results revealed that extracted relations by our method contained much more meaningless relations than those by NLP-based methods. Nevertheless, they were useful in an application of speculating the meaning of unknown terms, improving the recall by more than 0.06 points and decreasing the accuracy by only 0.04 points (the improvement of the F1-measure was 0.03 points). We found from the results that the coverage of conceptualized relations is important to improve the precision in the application. This is because the lack of knowledge (conceptualized relations) leads to misunderstanding of the meaning of unknown terms, as we humans misunderstand things with our insufficient knowledge.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"32.98429319"},{"venue":"WI-IAT","id":"1e5b0e6d29d81ff2045068c8daf30eb3efc999eb","venue_1":"WI-IAT","year":"2014","title":"SocialTrust: Adaptive Trust Oriented Incentive Mechanism for Social Commerce","authors":"Zeinab Noorian, Mohsen Mohkami, Yuan Liu, Hui Fang, Julita Vassileva, Jie Zhang","author_ids":"2994264, 2705759, 1826185, 2326573, 1681161, 2710322","abstract":"In the absence of legal authorities and enforcement mechanisms in open e-marketplaces, it is extremely challenging for a user to validate the quality of opinions (i.e. Ratings and reviews) of products or services provided by other users (referred as advisers).

These accounts need to select an appropriate number of tweets that match the followers' interests. If they retweet too many or too few tweets, it annoys the followers or degrade the value of the accounts. They also need to retweet them in a timely manner. If they retweet a tweet long after they receive it, the informational value of the tweet may diminish before the followers read it. There is, however, a trade-off between these two requirements. If they select tweets after seeing all the candidates, they can select the best given number of tweets, but in order to provide timely information, they have to decide to (or not to) retweet each tweet before seeing all the following candidates. In order to help the management of such Twitter accounts, we developed a system that reads a sequence of tweets from the friends one by one, and select a given number of (or less) tweets in an online (or near-online) fashion. In this paper, we propose four algorithms for it. Two of them give priority to the timeliness, and make a decision immediately after reading a new tweet by comparing its score with a threshold. The other two give priority to the selection quality, and make a decision after seeing some following tweets: after seeing incoming tweets for a fixed length of time or after seeing a fixed number of tweets. The former two are truly online algorithms and the latter two are near-online algorithms. Our experiment shows that the near-online algorithms achieve high selection quality only with acceptable time delays.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"91.36125654"},{"venue":"WI-IAT","id":"65bf8512797557d0484d85fd75c6bff9d394e3e9","venue_1":"WI-IAT","year":"2014","title":"Ranking of Coordinate Terms and Hypernyms Using a Hypernym-Hyponym Dictionary","authors":"Kosetsu Tsukuda, Hiroaki Ohshima, Katsumi Tanaka","author_ids":"2179434, 1698449, 1750132","abstract":"In this paper, methods for ranking coordinate terms and hypernyms of a given query according to their appropriateness are proposed.

Unlike these studies, we rank coordinate terms and hypernyms of a query and evaluate the terms by considering their appropriateness. In the proposed method, a bipartite graph is created based on hypernyms of a query and hyponyms of each hypernym using a hypernym-hyponym dictionary. Subsequently, we apply a HITS-based algorithm to the bipartite graph and rank coordinate terms and hypernyms based on their appropriateness. The experimental results obtained using 50 queries demonstrate that our method could rank appropriate coordinate terms and hypernyms higher than other comparable methods.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"32.98429319"},{"venue":"WI-IAT","id":"b250a9bd5d2761af962ec82b70068412faa8bd23","venue_1":"WI-IAT","year":"2014","title":"Optimizing Context Computation for Multiagent Simulations","authors":"Flavien Balbo, Mahdi Zargayouna, Fabien Badeig","author_ids":"1754915, 1790569, 2963588","abstract":"The execution of a multiagent-based simulation (MABS) model necessitates a scheduler that synchronizes the agents execution and simulates the simultaneity of their behaviors. In the majority of MABS frameworks the scheduler activates the agents who compute their context to decide the action to execute. This context computation process is time-consuming and is one of the barriers to increased use of MABS for large simulations. The context of an agent is computed based on all information he possesses about himself, the other agents and the objects of the environment that are accessible to him. One of the issues is to find this information and to identify the information subsets that make sense for the agent. In the majority of MABS, the context computation is hidden in the agent processes and there is no specific algorithm enabling to decrease its computing. Our proposal is the modeling of this subset of information identifying a context by a so called \"filter\" and an algorithm to find efficiently for each agent all their filters. The accessible information are given by the scheduler to the agents who browse a tree of filters to select the right information. With these filters, the agents know their context and decide which action to execute. Our algorithm is compared to a classical context identification. Promising results are presented and discussed.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"32.98429319"},{"venue":"WI-IAT","id":"0ec3aa10421f1f6af252bbf64139026835899408","venue_1":"WI-IAT","year":"2014","title":"Fuzzy Subjective Sentiment Phrases: A Context Sensitive and Self-Maintaining Sentiment Lexicon","authors":"Seyed Ali Bahrainian, Marcus Liwicki, Andreas Dengel","author_ids":"3091795, 1743758, 1703343","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel self-maintaining, domain-independent, and context-sensitive Sentiment Lexicon (SL) which finds and maps opinion words and phrases to a fuzzy sentiment score ranging from strong negative to strong positive.

Since users interact with social brands in social platforms, their opinions on specific topics are inevitably dependent on many social effects such as user preference on topics, peer influence, user profile information, etc. In this paper, we present a systematic framework to identify sentiments by incorporating user social effects besides textual information.
