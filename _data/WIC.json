They respond to human needs such as information sharing, friendship, and recreation. In this paper, we present a VC Management System, based on a Multi-Agent Oriented Programming (MAOP) approach. Using the MAOP <b>JaCaMo</b> platform, we make possible to install a decentralized and open management of those communities in a context of smart cities. Participants of a virtual community are each supported by a <b>Jason</b> agent that encapsulates the logic and the control of the user participation to a VC (such as publishing posts, notifying members, etc.). A set of <b>CArtAgO</b> artifacts provides the basic functionalities and operations giving access to the basic functionalities for knowledge exchange in such VC. Agents can exploit those artifacts to execute their tasks while achieving their individual and collective goals. The global coordination strategies enforcing behaviors of the participants of a VC are expressed as multi-agent normative organizations managed by the <b>Moise</b> framework.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"43.75"}]}
