Scalable Computing Architecture technology allows multiple V-Class cabinets to be interconnected, forming a single cache coherent non-uniform memory architecture (ccNUMA) system providing up to 128 CPUs and 128 GB of memory. This paper discusses some interesting aspects of the Scalable Computing Architecture and the changes made to the HP-UX kernel to operate in this environment.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"20"}]}
