The usual models of cooperative game theory assume that the desired outcome is either the grand coalition or a coalition structure that consists of disjoint coalitions (i.e., a partition of the set of agents). However, in practice an agent may be involved in executing more than one task, and distributing his resources between several (not necessarily disjoint) coalitions. To tackle such scenarios, we introduce a model for cooperative games with overlapping coalitions. We then focus on concepts of stability in this setting. In particular, we define and study a notion of the core, which is a generalization of the corresponding notion in the traditional models of cooperative game theory. Under some quite general conditions, we provide a characterization for the outcomes of a game to be in the core. As a corollary, we also show that any element of the core maximizes the social welfare. We then introduce a concept of balancedness for overlapping coalitional games, and use it to characterize coalition structures that can be extended to elements of the core. Furthermore, we generalize the notion of convexity to our setting, and show that under some natural assumptions convex games have a non-empty core. Finally, we explore alternative definitions of allowable deviations, and the corresponding notions of stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a generic model for overlapping coalition formation, along with a theoretical treatment of stability in this setting.","cites":"10","conferencePercentile":"65.68627451"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"d82d9019e886494b8f0540b96859c2f4db50aad1","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2012","title":"Biased Assimilation, Homophily, and the Dynamics of Polarization - (Working Paper)","authors":"Pranav Dandekar, Ashish Goel, David Lee","author_ids":"1679575, 1679667, 2344788","abstract":"We study the issue of polarization in society through a model of opinion formation. We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content.","cites":"16","conferencePercentile":"86.76470588"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"6c92d8263382ad203825ed4c64d04453026315f7","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2012","title":"Mechanism Design for Time Critical and Cost Critical Task Execution via Crowdsourcing","authors":"Swaprava Nath, Pankaj Dayama, Dinesh Garg, Y.

In this paper, we address the problem of a planner who needs to incentivize agents within a network in order to seek their help in executing an atomic task as well as in recruiting other agents to execute the task. We study this mechanism design problem under two natural resource optimization settings: (1) cost critical tasks, where the planner's goal is to minimize the total cost, and (2) time critical tasks, where the goal is to minimize the total time elapsed before the task is executed. We identify a set of desirable properties that should ideally be satisfied by a crowdsourcing mechanism. In particular, sybil-proofness and collapse-proofness are two complementary properties in our desiderata. We prove that no mechanism can satisfy all the desirable properties simultaneously. This leads us naturally to explore approximate versions of the critical properties. We focus our attention on approximate sybil-proofness and our exploration leads to a parametrized family of payment mechanisms which satisfy collapse-proofness. We characterize the approximate versions of the desirable properties in cost critical and time critical domain.","cites":"6","conferencePercentile":"60.29411765"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"8b7b3067fcc26ae4967ec0e912f657810fd47e7a","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2013","title":"Competition in the Presence of Social Networks: How Many Service Providers Maximize Welfare?","authors":"Moran Feldman, Reshef Meir, Moshe Tennenholtz","author_ids":"1715024, 1769579, 1708847","abstract":"Competition for clients among service providers is a classical situation discussed in the economics literature. While better service attracts more clients, in some cases clients may prefer to keep using a low quality service if their friends are also using the same serviceâ€”a phenomenon largely encouraged by the Internet and online social networks. This is evident, for example, in competition between cloud storage service providers such as DropBox, Microsoft SkyDrive and Google Drive. In such settings, the utility of a client depends on both the proposed service level and the number of friends or colleagues using the same service. We study how the welfare of the clients is affected by competition in the presence of social connections. Quite expectantly, competition among two firms can significantly increase the clients' social welfare in comparison with the monopoly case. However, we show that a further increase in competition triggered by the entry of additional firms may be hazardous for the society (i.e., to the clients), which stands in contrast to the typical situation in competition. Indeed, we show via equilibrium analysis that the social benefit of additional firms beyond the duopoly is limited, whereas the potential loss from such an addition is unbounded.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"32.75862069"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"11df6efbb7d26e208bbdd41a35b20970ce4cfbec","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2010","title":"A Novel Approach to Propagating Distrust","authors":"Christian Borgs, Jennifer T.

Targeted attacks include, for example, cyber-espionage, while non-targeted attacks include botnet recruitment. We are concerned with the subclass of these attacks for which detection is too costly or technically infeasible given the capabilities of a typical organization. As a result, defenders have to mitigate potential damages under a regime of incomplete information. A primary mitigation strategy is to reset potentially compromised resources to a known safe state, for example, by reinstalling computer systems, and changing passwords or cryptographic private keys. In a game-theoretic framework, we study the economically optimal mit-igation strategies in the presence of targeted and non-targeted covert attacks.

Our strategy operates by using an initial sample to learn enough about the distribution to determine how best to allocate to future customers, together with an analysis of structural properties of optimal solutions that allow for uniform convergence analysis. We show, for instance, if customers have {0, 1} valuations over items, and the goal of the allocator is to give each customer an item he or she values, we can efficiently produce such an allocation with cost at most a constant factor greater than the minimum over such allocations in hindsight, so long as the marginal costs do not decrease too rapidly.

In chunked-reward advertising , the publisher promises to deliver at least a certain volume (a.k.a. tipping point or lower bound) of user traffic to an advertiser according to their mutual contract. At the same time, the advertiser may specify a maximum volume (upper bound) of traffic that he/she would like to pay for according to his/her budget constraint. The objective of the publisher is to design an appropriate mechanism to allocate the user traffic so as to maximize the overall revenue obtained from all such advertisers. In this paper, we perform a formal study on this problem, which we call Chunked-reward Allocation Problem (CAP). In particular, we formulate CAP as a knapsack-like problem with variable-sized items and majorization constraints. Our main results regarding CAP are as follows. (1) We first show that for a special case of CAP, in which the lower bound equals the upper bound for each contract, there is a simple dynamic programming-based algorithm that can find an optimal allocation in pseudo-polynomial time. (2) The general case of CAP is much more difficult than the special case. To solve the problem, we first discover several structural properties of the optimal allocation, and then design a two-layer dynamic programming-based algorithm that can find an optimal allocation in pseudo-polynomial time by leveraging these properties. (3) We convert the two-layer dynamic programming based algorithm to a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), using the technique developed in [8], combined with some careful modifications of the dynamic programs.

Specifically, they have pure strategy Nash equilibria, which may be found by a polynomial time algorithm. However, these results were accompanied by a very limiting assumption that each player is capable of using any subset of its available set of resources. This is often unrealisticâ€”for example, resources may have complementarities between them such that a minimal number of resources is required for any to be useful. To remove this restriction, in this paper we prove the existence and tractability of a pure strategy equilibrium for a much more general setting where each player is given a matroid over the set of resources, along with the (upper and lower) bounds on the size of a subset of resources to be selected, and its strategy space consists of all elements of this matroid that fit in the given size range. (This, in particular, includes the possibility of having a full matroid, or having a set of bases of a matroid.) Moreover, we show that if a player strategy space in a given CAG does not satisfy these matroid properties, then a pure strategy equilibrium need not exist, and in fact the determination of whether or not a game has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium is NP-complete. We further prove analogous results for each of the congestion-averse conditions on utility functions, thus showing that current assumptions on strategy and utility structures in this model cannot be relaxed anymore.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"36.73469388"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"4bdc4ceb164663c85a9cc9cf036bb9b2b368396d","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2009","title":"News Posting by Strategic Users in a Social Network","authors":"Mangesh Gupte, Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi, Lu Han, Liviu Iftode, Pravin Shankar, Raluca M.

The model is appealing because it allows for linear-quadratic payoff functions and for very general interaction patterns among agents. We ask: How do different link patterns affect contributions? How are contributions affected by whether these goods are strategic complements, substitutes, or something in between? Who contributes and who free rides? How is the computational complexity of optimal play affected by the externalities of the game? What networks optimize social contributions and social welfare? And how does the worst-case equilibrium performance of a network compare to its best-case performance? The analysis finds that Nash equilibria of this game always exist and that they are computable by solving a linear complementarity problem. The equilibrium is unique when goods are strategic complements or weak substitutes and contributions are proportional to a network centrality measure called the Bonacich index. In the case of public goods, the equilibrium is non-unique and for every network there is an equilibrium where some individuals contribute optimally and others completely free-ride. Moreover , these equilibria with complete free-riders and optimal contributors are the only candidate stable equilibria are are characterized by k-order maximal independent sets. We find that the structure of optimal networks is hub-like when the game exhibits strict or weak complements. Under public good scenarios, while hub-like networks remain optimal in the best case, they also yield the worst-performing equilibria. Finally, we discuss two network-based policies for improving the equilibrium performance of networks.","cites":"14","conferencePercentile":"61.11111111"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"7695c4d5468274234125cbc0e3377652d6c94df7","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2011","title":"Prior-Independent Multi-parameter Mechanism Design","authors":"Nikhil R.

Each agent's value or opportunity cost for the item is their private information and preferences are quasi-linear. Trade between agents employs a double oral auction (DOA) in which both buyers and sellers call out bids or offers which an auctioneer recognizes. Transactions resulting from accepted bids and offers are recorded. This continues until there are no more acceptable bids or offers. Remarkably, the experiment consistently terminates in a Walrasian price. The main result of this paper is a mechanism in the spirit of the DOA that converges to a Walrasian equilibrium in a polynomial number of steps, thus providing a theoretical basis for the above-described empirical phenomenon. It is well-known that computation of a Walrasian equilibrium for this market corresponds to solving a maximum weight bipartite matching problem. The uncoordinated but rational responses of agents thus solve in a distributed fashion a maximum weight bipartite matching problem that is encoded by their private valuations. We show, furthermore, that every Walrasian equilibrium is reachable by some sequence of responses. This is in contrast to the well known auction algorithms for this problem which only allow one side to make offers and thus essentially choose an equilibrium that maximizes the surplus for the side making offers. Our results extend to the setting where not every agent pair is allowed to trade with each other.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"31.81818182"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"5531e4015e9eae882a9c34658a0075b11feaa9b9","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2008","title":"Local Two-Stage Myopic Dynamics for Network Formation Games","authors":"Esteban Arcaute, Ramesh Johari, Shie Mannor","author_ids":"2506563, 1790944, 1712535","abstract":"Network formation games capture two conflicting objectives of self-interested nodes in a network.

The motivation for this comes from the work of Kelly, Maulloo, and Tan [15] and Kelly and Vazirani [16] on rate control in communication networks. We consider a tree like network in which root is the source and all the leaf nodes are the sinks. Each sink has got a fixed amount of money which it can use to buy the capacities of the edges in the network. The edges of the network sell their capacities at certain prices. The objective of each edge is to fix a price which can fetch the maximum money for it and the objective of each sink is to buy capacities on edges in such a way that it can facilitate the sink to pull maximum flow from the source. In this problem, the edges and the sinks play precisely the role of sellers and buyers, respectively, in the Fisher's market model. The utility of a buyer (or sink) takes the form of Leontief function which is known for not satisfying Gross substitutability property. We develop an O(m 3) exact combinatorial algorithm for computing equilibrium prices of the edges. The time taken by our algorithm is independent of the values of sink money and edge capacities. A corollary of our algorithm is that equilibrium prices and flows are rational numbers. Although there are algorithms to solve this problem but they are all based on convex programming techniques. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first strongly polynomial time exact combinatorial algorithm for computing equilibrium prices of Fisher model under the case when buyers' utility functions do not satisfy Gross substitutability property.","cites":"10","conferencePercentile":"70.45454545"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"3b2fc3b1f615478d0e4aa98ca6e8dee4a4e1ccdf","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2005","title":"Computing Equilibria in a Fisher Market with Linear Single-Constraint Production Units","authors":"Kamal Jain, Mohammad Mahdian","author_ids":"1800444, 7962175","abstract":"We study the problem of computing equilibrium prices in a Fisher market with linear utilities and linear single-constraint production units.

We study here a problem in which an auctioneer would like to sell a single item, say a car. A bidder may make a bid for the item at any time but expects an immediate irrevocable decision. The goal of the auctioneer is to maximize her revenue in this uncertain environment. Under some reasonable assumptions, it has been observed that the on-line auction problem has strong connections to the classical secretary problem in which an employer would like to choose the best candidate among n competing candidates [HKP04]. However, a direct application of the algorithms for the secretary problem to online auctions leads to undesirable consequences since these algorithms do not give a fair chance to every candidate and candidates arriving early in the process have an incentive to delay their arrival. In this work we study the issue of incentives in the online auction problem where bidders are allowed to change their arrival time if it benefits them. We derive incentive compatible mechanisms where the best strategy for each bidder is to first truthfully arrive at their assigned time and then truthfully reveal their valuation. Using the linear programming technique introduced in Buchbinder et al [BJS10], we first develop new mechanisms for a variant of the secretary problem. We then show that the new mechanisms for the secretary problem can be used as a building block for a family of incentive compatible mechanisms for the online auction problem which perform well under different performance criteria. In particular, we design a mechanism for the online auction problem which is incentive compatible and is 3/16 â‰ˆ 0.187-competitive for revenue, and a (different) mechanism that is 1 2 âˆš e â‰ˆ 0.303-competitive for efficiency.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"27.63157895"},{"venue":"WINE","id":"50e6bb5811408aa0222bd930ab67a8a554f96374","venue_1":"WINE","year":"2005","title":"A Simple Characterization for Truth-Revealing Single-Item Auctions","authors":"Kamal Jain, Aranyak Mehta, Kunal Talwar, Vijay V.
