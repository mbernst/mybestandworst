Researchers in previous work have identified privacy hazards associated with Wi-Fi probe requests, such as leaking past access points identifiers and user mobility. Besides several efforts to develop privacy-preserving alternatives, modern mobile devices continue to use Wi-Fi probe requests. In this work, we quantify Wi-Fi probe requests' threat to privacy by conducting an experimental study of the most popular smartphones in different settings. Our objective is to identify how different factors influence the probing frequency and the average number of broadcasted probes. Our conclusions are worrisome: On average, some mobile devices send probe requests as often as 55 times per hour, thus revealing their unique MAC address at high frequency. Even if a mobile device is not charging and in sleep mode, it might broadcast about 2000 probes per hour. We also evaluate a commercially deployed MAC address randomization mechanism, and demonstrate a simple method to re-identify anonymized probes.","cites":"9","conferencePercentile":"97.05882353"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"adf4fbc05d13b29eac201fbcd9e11b1d0441468a","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2008","title":"Wireless authentication using remote passwords","authors":"Andrew Harding, Timothy W. van der Horst, Kent E.

Simple Authentication for the Web (SAW) facilitates dynamic user bases in the context of web site logins by enabling users to authenticate to personal messaging identifiers (e.g., email addresses, IM handles, cell phone numbers). SAW, however, is ill-suited for wireless authentication because, in most cases, it is dependent on client-side Internet connectivity. Wireless Authentication using Remote Passwords (WARP) overcomes this constraint by building a hybrid protocol that combines the principles of SAW authentication with the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"12.06896552"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"b7698b3541f8f1f761e950890c12950fedf1c672","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2010","title":"Preventing multi-query attack in location-based services","authors":"Nilothpal Talukder, Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed","author_ids":"1692757, 1741081","abstract":"Despite increasing popularity, Location-based Services (LBS) (e.g., searching nearby points-of-interest on map) on mobile handheld devices have been subject to major privacy concerns for users. The existing third-party privacy protection methods hide the exact location of users from service providers by sending cloaking regions (CR) that contain several other user locations in the vicinity. However, this has not ensured LBS full immunity from the privacy concerns. In this paper, we describe a serious privacy problem of LBS called multi-query attack. In this attack, the exact location of the service requester can be inferred by the adversary through obtaining cloaking regions that are shrunk or extended in subsequent queries. This problem can be addressed by judiciously retaining, over a period of time, the cloaking regions for the same set of users. Most methods in the literature are weakened for considering only a static snapshot of users during evaluation. Thus, any update due to user movements in real time becomes very costly. Our proposed approach, ANNC (Adaptive Nearest Neighborhood Cloaking) ,emphasizes developing disjoint sets of users dynamically over time in order to share the common CRs. The CRs are organized in balanced binary trees with restricted height. Thus ANNC achieves the balance between search efficiency and quality of cloaking with higher anonymity levels. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that ANNC will be more efficient in practice than other well-known approaches.","cites":"8","conferencePercentile":"52.27272727"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"2e206b97ce245db1f150bd4280ad323239228914","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2016","title":"A Prover-Anonymous and Terrorist-Fraud Resistant Distance-Bounding Protocol","authors":"Xavier Bultel, SÃ©bastien Gambs, David Gerault, Pascal Lafourcade, Cristina Onete, Jean-Marc Robert","author_ids":"3399390, 1777382, 3385569, 3438430, 3219611, 2291969","abstract":"Contactless communications have become omnipresent in our daily lives, from simple access cards to electronic passports. Such systems are particularly vulnerable to <i>relay attacks</i>, in which an adversary relays the messages from a prover to a verifier. Distance-bounding protocols were introduced to counter such attacks. Lately, there has been a very active research trend on improving the security of these protocols, but also on ensuring strong privacy properties with respect to active adversaries and malicious verifiers.\n In particular, a difficult threat to address is the <i>terrorist fraud</i>, in which a far-away prover cooperates with a nearby accomplice to fool a verifier. The usual defence against this attack is to make it impossible for the accomplice to succeed unless the prover provides him with enough information to recover his secret key and impersonate him later on. However, the mere existence of a long-term secret key is problematic with respect to privacy.\n In this paper, we propose a <i>novel approach</i> in which the prover does not leak his secret key but a reusable session key along with a group signature on it. This allows the adversary to impersonate him even without knowing his signature key. Based on this approach, we give the first distance-bounding protocol, called SPADE, integrating anonymity, revocability and provable resistance to standard threat models.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"82.25806452"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"1ebcbe54c115e1ec75dd622257472d44cc745b9a","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2009","title":"An attacker model for MANET routing security","authors":"Jared Cordasco, Susanne Wetzel","author_ids":"1718085, 1739446","abstract":"Mobile ad-hoc networks are becoming ever more popular due to their flexibility, low cost, and ease of deployment.

We consider several classes of state-of-the-art RAAs that include the SampleRate, ONOE, AMRR, and the RAA used in Atheros Microsoft Windows XP driver. We model the behavior of these algorithms, and show the existence of very efficient attacks that exploit RAA-specific vulnerabilities as well as the inherent weaknesses that exist in the design of IEEE802.11 MAC and link layer protocol: in particular the overt packet rate information being transmitted, predictable rate selection mechanism, performance anomaly caused by the equiprobability of transmissions among all nodes regardless of the data rates being employed, and the lack of interference differentiation from poor link quality by IEEE802.11 RAAs. In this work, we present algorithms that determine optimal jamming strategies against RAAs for a given jamming budget, and experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of these smart jamming attacks, which can be orders of magnitude more efficient than naive jamming. For example, in the case of SampleRate, eight reactive jamming pulses every second are sufficient to achieve the same network throughput degradation achieved by a periodic jammer with the jamming energy cost 100 times higher. Some of the RAAs react even worse to smart jamming attacks; ONOE in particular suffers from the phenomenon of congestion collapse where the nodes fail to recover from the lowest data rate even after the jammer stops jamming. At the end, we summarize fundamental reasons behind such RAA vulnerabilities and propose a preliminary set of mitigation techniques. We leave the experimental demonstration of the efficiency of the proposed mitigation mechanisms for future work.","cites":"31","conferencePercentile":"94.73684211"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"2bfbfb72a149ebcbb0761d0653626e6de02e0b4d","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2008","title":"Anti-jamming timing channels for wireless networks","authors":"Wenyuan Xu, Wade Trappe, Yanyong Zhang","author_ids":"1737805, 1702051, 1813845","abstract":"Wireless communication is susceptible to radio interference, which prevents the reception of communications.

Especially traffic efficiency applications benefit from wide-area message dissemination, and aggregation of information is an important tool to reduce bandwidth requirements and enable dissemination in large areas. The core idea is to exchange high quality summaries of the current status rather than forwarding all individual messages. Securing aggregation schemes is important, because they may be used for decisions about traffic management, as well as traffic statistics used in political decisions concerning road safety and availability. The most important challenge for security is that aggregation removes redundancy and the option to directly verify signatures on atomic messages. Existing proposals are limited, because they require roads to be segmented into small fixed-size regions, beyond which aggregation cannot be performed. In this paper, we introduce SeDyA, a scheme that allows more dynamic aggregation compared to existing work, while also providing stronger security guarantees. We evaluate SeDyA against existing proposals to show the benefits in terms of information accuracy, bandwidth usage, and resilience against attacks.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"26"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"6a51b5b254f1c00b0ba6535d99406a101fa90d29","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2008","title":"RFID security and privacy: long-term research or short-term tinkering?","authors":"Gene Tsudik, Mike Burmester, Ari Juels, Alfred Kobsa, David Molnar, Roberto Di Pietro, Melanie R.

Since roughly 2001, a number of researchers have stepped up to the plate and proposed techniques for strengthening RFID security and privacy, while others have focused on attacking (and demonstrating weaknesses in) currently deployed RFID systems. Despite a few PhD theses devoted to this topic, it remains to be seen whether there are any new long-term fundamental issues involved in RFID security &amp; privacy. Therefore, this panel's goal is to present and debate the panelists' diverse perspectives on the future (or lack thereof) of RFID security and privacy research.\n One line of thought is that this topic is a mere fad. After all, RFID tags are computational amoebas, akin to dumb sensors that sense nothing. RFID tags do not network and do not collect anything; hence, the only interaction worth considering is between a tag and a reader. Is there anything challenging remaining beyond the set of cryptographically contortionist protocols and techniques already proposed in the literature?\n An opposing point of view is that RFID technology has opened up a new and exciting avenue for research which is here to stay. Although some basic protocols have been designed, there are several important outstanding issues, including (but not limited to) the following. One purely technical issue that remains unaddressed is how to handle revocation of rogue readers. Inherent lack of on-board clocks makes revocation checking very difficult. There is also the problem of secure pairing of personal RFID tags (e.g., in passports and transponders) with other ubiquitous devices, e.g., cell-phones, laptops or PDAs. Another is the design of inexpensive and robust privacy \"shields\" for protecting RFID tags -- carried by a potentially unwitting user -- from leaking information. Yet another important unexplored issue is <i>user perception</i> and, more generality, usability aspects of RFID tags. This is surprising since, unlike sensors/WSNs or MANETs, RFID tags are expected to be close and relevant to the average user/consumer.\n This international panel is composed of academic and industrial experts in cryptography, security/privacy and usability, each with a track record of research results in the respective aspects of RFID technology.

This paper provides the first large-scale study of paid apps. We analyse top paid apps obtained from four different countries: Australia, Brazil, Germany, and US, and quantify the level of tracking taking place in paid apps in comparison to free apps. Our analysis shows that 60% of the paid apps are connected to trackers that collect personal information compared to 85%--95% in free apps. We further show that approximately 20% of the paid apps are connected to more than three trackers. With tracking being pervasive in both free and paid apps, we then quantify the aggregated privacy leakages associated with individual users. Using the data of user installed apps of over 300 smartphone users, we show that 50% of the users are exposed to more than 25 trackers which can result in significant leakages of privacy.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"64.70588235"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"fc0eefc6b12383848824288c851206d6388d71ec","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2012","title":"Security for cyber-physical systems: case studies with medical devices, robots, and automobiles","authors":"Tadayoshi Kohno","author_ids":"1769675","abstract":"Today's and tomorrow's emerging technologies and cyber-physical systems have the potential to greatly improve the quality of our lives.

Imagine the following scenario: In a not so distant future you have just purchased a number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) appliances for your smart home. You are standing in your living room and would like to have these new devices wirelessly connect to each other and your home network. The set of your own devices in your network constitute your trust domain. Most IoT devices are equipped with environmental sensors, e.g., for monitoring ambient luminosity, audio, or temperature. A breach in your trust domain could leak such sensor data, and hence potentially sensitive private information about your behavior and habits, to outsiders. Therefore, you want to make sure that none of your devices accidentally connect to your neighbor's home network. You also want to make sure that only your own devices are granted access to your trust domain. The devices could use appropriate service discovery and key exchange protocols to establish secure communication links with each other and other devices like the home WiFi router. But how can your devices distinguish between other devices that belong to your trust domain and devices of your neighbors that happen to lie within wireless communication range? That is, how can devices in a trust domain (e.g., your home) authenticate each other? 2.

Abhishek Anand, Nitesh Saxena","author_ids":"8696579, 1716235","abstract":"Pairing between wireless devices may be secured by the use of an auxiliary channel such as audio, visuals or vibrations. A simple approach to pairing involves one of the devices initiating the transmission of a key, or keying material like a short password, over the auxiliary channel to the other device. A successful pairing is achieved when the receiving device is able to decode the key without any errors while the attacker is unable to eavesdrop the key.\n In this paper, we focus on the security of the vibration channel when used for the key transmission. As shown in some recent work, sending the keying material over a clear vibrational channel poses a significant risk of an acoustic side channel attack. Specifically, an adversary can listen onto the acoustic sounds generated by the vibration motor of the sending device and infer the keying material with a high accuracy. To counteract this threat, we propose a novel pairing scheme, called <i>Vibreaker</i> (a ``Vibrating speaker''), that involves active injection of acoustic noise in order to mask the key signal. In this scheme, the sending device artificially injects noise in the otherwise clear audio channel while transmitting the keying material via vibrations. We experiment with several choices for the noise signal and demonstrate that the security of the audio channel is significantly enhanced with Vibreaker when appropriate noise is used. The scheme requires no additional effort by the user, and imposes minimum hardware requirement and hence can be applied to many different contexts, such as pairing of IoT and implanted devices, wearables and other commodity gadgets.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"82.25806452"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"228fd67eba0b6b723363c10dd672bf8c781beb88","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2008","title":"Body sensor network security: an identity-based cryptography approach","authors":"Chiu Chiang Tan, Haodong Wang, Sheng Zhong, Qun Li","author_ids":"1724352, 2758920, 1782313, 1686663","abstract":"A body sensor network (BSN), is a network of sensors deployed on a person's body, usually for health care monitoring.

Recent research has focused on how driver assistance technologies can be used to mitigate traffic fatalities and create more enjoyable commutes. In this work, we consider cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) or platooning, a driver assistance technology that controls the speed of vehicles and inter-vehicle spacing. CACC equipped cars use radar to fine tune inter-vehicle spacing and dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) to collaboratively accelerate and decelerate. Platooning can reduce fuel consumption by over 5% and increases the density of cars on a highway. Previous work on platooning has focused on proving string stability, which guarantees that the error between cars does not grow with the length of a platoon, but little work has considered the impact an attacker can have on a platoon. To design safe distributed controllers and networks it is essential to understand the possible attacks that could be mounted against platoons.\n In this work, we design a set of insider attacks and abnormal behaviors that occur in a platoon of cars. For example, we introduce the collision induction attack where an attacker exploits the platoon controller to cause a high-speed accident with the car following it. To mitigate these insider attacks we design a model-based detection scheme that leverages the broadcast nature of DSRC. Each car uses DSRC messages from other cars in the platoon to model the expected behavior of the car directly preceding it. If the expected behavior and actual behavior differ the monitoring vehicle switches to non-cooperative ACC, relying solely on radar, to mitigate the impact of the attack. We show that our detection scheme is able to detect many of our proposed insider attacks and when combined with a well designed ACC controller can avoid collisions. We propose combining our detection scheme with a global reputation scheme to detect when a car is malicious or needs maintenance.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"64.70588235"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"d515c9c7836335fa16164d8081340fb977e75e52","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2015","title":"A framework for evaluating pseudonym strategies in vehicular ad-hoc networks","authors":"David FÃ¶rster, Frank Kargl, Hans LÃ¶hr","author_ids":"2624151, 1728575, 1731980","abstract":"The standard approach to privacy-friendly authentication in vehicular ad-hoc networks is the use of pseudonym certificates.

This system is very coarse grained, however, and can allow applications far greater access to sensitive data than a user might intend.\n In this paper, we present a novel technique called <i>priVy</i> that merges static bytecode weaving and database query rewriting to achieve low-level access control for Android native providers at the application level. <i>priVy</i> defines access control for both database schema and entities and does not require any modifications to the underlying operating system and/or framework code.

In this paper, we identify three library-centric threats in the real-world Android application markets: (i) the library modification threat, (ii) the masquerading threat and (iii) the aggressive library threat. These three threats cannot effectively be fully addressed by existing defense mechanisms such as software analysis, anti-virus software and anti-repackaging techniques. To mitigate these threats, we propose Duet, a library integrity verification tool for Android applications at application stores. This is non-trivial because the Android application build process merges library code and application-specific logic into a single binary file. Our approach uses reverse-engineering to achieve integrity verification. We implemented a full working prototype of Duet. In a dataset with 100,000 Android applications downloaded from Google Play between February 2012 and September 2013, we verify integrity of 15 libraries. On average, 80.50% of libraries can pass the integrity verification. In-depth analysis indicates that code insertion, obfuscation, and optimization on libraries by application developers are the primary reasons for not passing integrity verification. The evaluation results not only indicate that Duet is an effective tool to mitigate library-centric attacks, but also provide empirical insight into the library integrity situation in the wild.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"32.69230769"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"8dba2a210a43d7616662f5a6abe1fbd51fabca73","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2009","title":"Privacy-preserving 802.11 access-point discovery","authors":"Janne Lindqvist, Tuomas Aura, George Danezis, Teemu Koponen, Annu Myllyniemi, Jussi MÃ¤ki, Michael Roe","author_ids":"1735867, 1710566, 1722262, 2462394, 2626161, 2660672, 2398096","abstract":"It is usual for 802.11 WLAN clients to probe actively for access points in order to hasten AP discovery and to find \"hidden\" APs.

In this work we present finite-energy jamming games, a game model that allows a jammer and sender to choose (1) whether to transmit or sleep, (2) a power level to transmit with, and (3) what channel to transmit on. We also allow the jammer to choose on how many channels it simultaneously attacks. A major addition in finite-energy jamming games is that the jammer and sender both have a limited amount of energy which is drained according to the actions a player takes.\n We develop a model of our system as a zero-sum finite-horizon stochastic game with deterministic transitions. We leverage the zero-sum and finite-horizon properties of our model to design a simple polynomial-time algorithm to compute optimal randomized strategies for both players. The utility function of our game model can be decoupled into a recursive equation. Our algorithm exploits this fact to use dynamic programming to construct solutions in a bottom-up fashion. For each state of energy levels, a linear program is solved to find Nash equilibrium strategies for the subgame. With these techniques, our algorithm has only a linear dependence on the number of states, and quadratic dependence on the number of actions, allowing us to solve very large instances.\n By computing Nash equilibria for our game models, we explore what kind of performance guarantees can be achieved both for the sender and jammer, when playing against an optimal opponent. We also use the optimal strategies to simulate finite-energy jamming games and provide insights into robust communication among reconfigurable, yet energy-limited, radio systems. To test the performance of the optimal strategies we compare their performance with a random and adaptive strategy. Matching our intuition, the aggressiveness of an attacker is related to how much of a discount is placed on data delay. This results in the defender often choosing to sleep despite the latency implication, because the threat of jamming is high. We also present several other findings from simulations where we vary the strategies for one or both of the players.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"53.84615385"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"cd42108fdc0eb84b2041e0206e412ee0fd6f16c2","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2013","title":"Tap-Wave-Rub: Lightweight Malware Prevention for Smartphones Using Intuitive Human Gestures","authors":"Haoyu Li, Di Ma, Nitesh Saxena, Babins Shrestha, Yan Zhu","author_ids":"5773735, 5784153, 1716235, 2042385, 1746624","abstract":"We introduce a lightweight permission enforcement approach - <i>Tap-Wave-Rub (TWR)</i> - for smartphone malware prevention.

In the recently proposed cooperative cellular networks, geographically separated multiple BSs cooperate on transmission in order to improve the UE's signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at cell-edge region. The service provider of the system dynamically assigns the cluster of BSs to achieve higher SINR for the UE while optimizing the use of system radio resources.

Consequently, the security community has started exploring defenses to such side channel attacks, but the suggested solutions are either not effective (e.g., those based on vibrational noise) and/or may significantly undermine system usability (e.g., those based on keyboard layout randomization).\n In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical defense to motion-based touchstroke leakage based on <i>system-generated, fully automated</i> and <i>user-oblivious</i> sensory noise. Our defense leverages a recently developed framework, SMASheD, that takes advantage of the Android's ADB functionality and can programmatically inject noise to various inertial sensors. Although SMASheD was originally advertised as a malicious app by its authors, we use it to build a defense mechanism, called <i>Slogger</i> (\"Smashing the logger\"), for defeating sensor-based touchstroke logging attacks. Slogger transparently inserts noisy sensor readings in the background as the user provides sensitive touchscreen input (e.g., password, PIN or credit card info) in order to obfuscate the original sensor readings. It can be installed in the user space without the need to root the device and to change the device's OS or kernel.\n Our contributions are three-fold. <i>First</i>, we introduce Slogger, identifying a novel, benign use case of SMASheD that can defeat touchstroke logging attacks. <i>Second</i>, we design and implement the Slogger app system that can be used to protect sensitive touchscreen input from leaking away. <i>Third</i>, we comprehensively evaluate Slogger against state-of-the-art touchstroke detection and inference attacks.

IR-UWB was proposed as a possible solution, but we show that the de facto standard for IR-UWB, IEEE 802.15.4a, does not automatically provide security against such attacks. We find that with the mandatory modes of the standard an external attacker can decrease the measured distance by as much as 140 meters with a high probability (above 99%).","cites":"11","conferencePercentile":"68.18181818"},{"venue":"WISEC","id":"58dfbe1e7d52d8a950c8d2bd56058047937a2d18","venue_1":"WISEC","year":"2008","title":"RFID security: in the shoulder and on the loading dock","authors":"Ari Juels","author_ids":"1687161","abstract":"RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) tags are microchips that communicate via radio.

There is a steady stream of news stories about the exponential growth of malware targeted at specific smartphone operating systems. Given the extent of smartphone usage, a malware epidemic affecting smartphones could potentially have devastating consequences. Yet, anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that malware infection of smartphones in the wild is not at the same scale as malware infection of personal computers. Estimates of the rates of malware infection on mobile devices are surprisingly rare. Even the few available public estimates differ greatly (ranging between 0.0009% to about 5%). We found only one previous independent and rigorous estimate [1] which used an indirect method to estimate infection rate of mobile devices using a dataset of DNS queries made by users in the United States. In this backdrop, we set out to estimate infection rates on Android devices directly by collecting data from a large number of devices (reported in [2]). In this talk, I will describe our experience and some lessons we learned. Infection rates in our dataset, according the two malware datasets we used, were small (about 0.26%) but significantly higher than the previous independent estimate [1]. Different anti-malware vendors use different criteria for deciding if a given software package is malicious. We were surprised to find that none of the malware instances found in our dataset was flagged as malware by a majority of vendors. Some application stores have a greater density of malicious applications than others. Advertising within applications and cross-promotional deals could potentially act as infection vectors whereby installing one application would lead to installing additional applications.

An adversary may identify the real event source through eavesdropping and traffic analysis. Previous work has studied the source location privacy problem under a <i>local</i> adversary model. In this work, we aim to provide a stronger notion: <i>event source unobservability</i>, which promises that a <i>global</i> adversary cannot know whether a real event has ever occurred even if he is capable of collecting and analyzing all the messages in the network at all the time. Clearly, event source unobservability is a desirable and critical security property for event monitoring applications, but unfortunately it is also very difficult and expensive to achieve for resource-constrained sensor network.\n Our main idea is to introduce carefully chosen dummy traffic to hide the real event sources in combination with mechanisms to drop dummy messages to prevent explosion of network traffic. To achieve the latter, we select some sensors as proxies that proactively filter dummy messages on their way to the base station. Since the problem of optimal proxy placement is NP-hard, we employ local search heuristics. We propose two schemes (i) Proxy-based Filtering Scheme (PFS) and (ii) Tree-based Filtering Scheme (TFS) to accurately locate proxies. Simulation results show that our schemes not only quickly find nearly optimal proxy placement, but also significantly reduce message overhead and improve message delivery ratio.

We overcome the bootstrapping problem encountered in all related prior work, demonstrating that Social PaL allows its users to find all paths of length two and to discover a significant fraction of longer paths, even when only a small fraction of OSN users is in the Social PaL system -- e.g., discovering 70% of all paths with only 40% of the users.

The ease-of-use of modern smartphones in combination with the proliferation of high-speed mobile networks facilitates a culture of spontaneous and often carefree sharing of user-generated content, especially photos and videos. An increasing number of modern devices are capable of embedding location information and other metadata into created content. However, currently there is not much user awareness of possible privacy consequences of such data. While in most cases users upload their own media consciously, the flood of media uploaded by others is so huge that it is almost impossible for users to stay aware of all media that might be relevant to them. Current social network services and photo-sharing sites mainly focus on the privacy of users' own media in terms of access control, but offer few possibilities to deal with privacy implications created by other users' actions. We conducted an online survey with 414 participants. The results show that users would like to get more information about media shared by others. Based on an analysis of prevalent sharing services like Flickr, Facebook, or Google+ and an analysis of metadata of three different sets of crawled photos, we discuss privacy implications and potentials of the emerging trend of (geo-)tagged media.

Accelerometers are applicable in a number of settings and circumstances, including important security and privacy domains. In this paper, we investigate the use of accelerometers for the purpose of true random number generation. As our first contribution, we discover that an accelerometer possesses two unique and appealing properties when used as an entropy source. First, contrary to intuition, an accelerometer can derive sufficient entropy even when it is stationary (i.e., not subject to perceivable acceleration). Next, and more importantly, the entropy of a stationary accelerometer can not be reduced in the presence of a variety of environmental variations or even under adversarial manipulations. This means that, unlike other sensors, accelerometers are resistant to changing environments, benign or otherwise. To support this claim, we develop a thorough experimental adversarial model for accelerometers that supply a system with entropy. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first real world model in the context of entropy collection. As our second contribution, we demonstrate the validity of accelerometer based random number generation on an RFID tag, which is a highly resource constrained device. We present the design and implementation of our method on an Intel WISP tag and conduct several novel experiments to evaluate its feasibility. Our results indicate that a high quality 128-bit random number can be extracted using an accelerometer in about 1.5 seconds even when the sensor is in a stationary state.
