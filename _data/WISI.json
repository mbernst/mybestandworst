Gayler, Kate Smith-Miles","author_ids":"2104801, 1899463, 3051216, 2848275","abstract":"Identity crime has increased enormously over the recent years. Spike detection is important because it highlights sudden and sharp rises in intensity relative to the current identity attribute value (which can be indicative of abuse). This paper proposes the new spike analysis framework for monitoring sparse personal identity streams. For each identity example, it detects spikes in single attribute values and integrates multiple spikes from different attributes to produce a numeric suspicion score. Although only temporal representation is examined here, experimental results on synthetic and real credit applications reveal some conditions on which the framework will perform well.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"100"}]}
