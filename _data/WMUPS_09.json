In order to provide adapted services to user and applications according to the global context, devices in a pervasive computing system are context-aware. In this paper, we present the modeling and the simulation of multiagent service oriented architecture for pervasive computing system. An important step toward the validation of the architecture is made. We used colored Petri nets as modeling formalism and CPN Tools for the simulation of scenarios.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"25"}]}
