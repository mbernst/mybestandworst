The iteration is stated in terms of (i) supremal sublanguage operators for each individual property, (ii) prefix-closures, and, (iii) language intersections. Within the iteration, the individual supremal sublanguage operators are only applied on prefix-closed languages, while the overall specification is not required to be prefix-closed. Our main result establishes finite convergence, provided that all parameters are regular.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"47.61904762"}]}
