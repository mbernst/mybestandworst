By far there are no standard programming paradigms for SOCs or heterogeneous chip mul-tiprocessors. Users are required to write complex assembly language and/or C programs for SOCs. Developing a standard programming model for this new parallel architecture is necessary. In this paper, we propose a practical OpenMP compiler for SOCs, especially targeting 3SoC. We also present our solutions to extend OpenMP directives to incorporate advanced architectural features of SOCs. Preliminary performance evaluation shows scalable speedup using different types of processors and effectiveness of performance improvement through optimization.","cites":"19","conferencePercentile":"100"}]}
