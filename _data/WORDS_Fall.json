Applications of such kind are characterised by being largely distributed and proactive, i.e. able to operate without human intervention. The anonymous and asynchronous paradigm, which is advocated by event models, has shown to be well-suited for this kind of applications. However, current real-time event-oriented middleware technologies do not provide a complete solution for the requirements of mobile ad hoc environments. In this paper, we present the research carried out on both a resource and a QoS management framework to achieve real-time support for an event system operating in mobile ad hoc environments. The framework makes use of both reflection and component technology. The implementation of our resource system is developed in OpenCOM, which is a lightweight, efficient and reflective model based on Microsoft's COM.","cites":"9","conferencePercentile":"95.23809524"}]}
