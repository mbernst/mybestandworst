Designed reservoir study provides a robust tool to quantify the impact of uncertainties in model input variables, and can be used to simulate, analyze, and optimize reservoir development. However, such studies are computationally challenging, involving massive (terabyte or petabyte) geographically distributed datasets and requiring hundreds or tens of thousands of simulation runs. Providing petroleum engineers with integrated workflow through a secure and easy-to-use user interface will enable new advanced reservoir studies. This paper describes the workflow solution and user interface designed and implemented for reservoir uncertainty analysis in the UCoMS project ( Ubiquitous Computing and Monitoring System for discovery and management of energy resources).","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"22.72727273"}]}
