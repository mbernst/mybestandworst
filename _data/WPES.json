Prior studies have provided evidence that it is possible to infer the social ties of users from their location and co-location traces but they lack one important component: the comparison of the inference accuracy between an internal attacker (e.g., a curious application running on a mobile device) and a realistic external eavesdropper in the same field trial. In this paper, we experimentally show that such an eavesdropper is able to infer the type of social relationships between mobile users better than an internal attacker. Moreover, our results indicate that by exploiting the underlying social community structure of mobile users, the accuracy of the inference attacks doubles. Based on our findings, we propose countermeasures to help users protect their privacy against eavesdroppers.","cites":"5","conferencePercentile":"65.51724138"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"1f678160875fdf1f6e487fa39df20a9d003f8fa8","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2005","title":"Privacy for RFID through trusted computing","authors":"David Molnar, Andrea Soppera, David Wagner","author_ids":"2804783, 2212526, 4073051","abstract":"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology raises significant privacy issues because it enables tracking of items and people possibly without their knowledge or consent. One of the biggest challenges for RFID technology is to provide privacy protection without raising tag production and management cost. We introduce a new architecture that uses trusted computing primitives to solve this problem. Our design splits the RFID reader into three software modules: a Reader Core with basic functionality, a Policy Engine that controls the use of RFID-derived data, and a Consumer Agent that performs privacy audits on the RFID reader and exports audit results to third party auditors. Readers use <i>remote attestation</i> to prove they are running a specific Reader Core, Policy Engine, and Consumer Agent. As a result, remote attestation allows concerned individuals to verify that RFID readers comply with privacy regulations, while also allowing the reader owner to verify that the reader has not been compromised.Furthermore, industry standards bodies have suggested several mechanisms to protect privacy in which authorized readers use a shared secret to authenticate themselves to the tag. These standards have not fully addressed issues of key management. First, how is the shared secret securely provided to the legitimate reader? Second, how do we guarantee that the reader will comply with a specific privacy policy? We show how, with remote attestation, the key-issuing authority can demand such a proof before releasing shared secrets to the reader. We also show how <i>sealed storage</i> can protect secrets even if the reader is compromised. Finally, we sketch how our design could be implemented today using existing RFID reader hardware.","cites":"28","conferencePercentile":"78.57142857"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"059f97b6ed741bfb005a347922b687d26d9abd53","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2002","title":"Use of a P3P user agent by early adopters","authors":"Lorrie Faith Cranor, Manjula Arjula, Praveen Guduru","author_ids":"1699751, 1858247, 2948647","abstract":"The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), provides a standard computer-readable format for privacy policies and a protocol that enables web browsers to read and process privacy policies automatically. P3P enables machine-readable privacy policies that can be retrieved automatically by web browsers and other user agent tools that can display symbols, prompt users, or take other appropriate actions. We developed the AT&amp;T Privacy Bird as a P3P user agent that can compare P3P policies against a user's privacy preferences. Since P3P was adopted as a W3C recommendation in April 2002, little work has been done to study how it is being used and, especially, its impact on users. Many questions have been raised about whether and how Internet users will make use of P3P, and how to build P3P user agents that will prove most useful to end users. In this paper we first provide a brief introduction to P3P and the AT&T Privacy Bird. Then we discuss a survey of AT&T Privacy Bird users that we conducted in August 2002. We found that a large proportion of AT&T Privacy Bird users began reading privacy policies more often and being more proactive about protecting their privacy as a result of using this software. Unfortunately, the usefulness of P3P user agents is severely limited by the number of web sites that have implemented P3P. Our survey results also suggest that if it becomes easier to compare privacy policy across e-commerce web sites, a significant group of consumers would likely use this information in their purchase decisions.","cites":"40","conferencePercentile":"70"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"264b337811e4add2b8f6c77fe5c09312ef8a9776","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2011","title":"Loose tweets: an analysis of privacy leaks on twitter","authors":"Huina Mao, Xin Shuai, Apu Kapadia","author_ids":"2389224, 1736363, 3163956","abstract":"Twitter has become one of the most popular microblogging sites for people to broadcast (or \"tweet\") their thoughts to the world in 140 characters or less. Since these messages are available for public consumption, one may expect these tweets not to contain private or incriminating information. Nevertheless we observe a large number of users who unwittingly post sensitive information about <i>themselves and other people</i> for whom there may be negative consequences. While some awareness exists of such privacy issues on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, there has been no quantitative, scientific study addressing this problem.\n In this paper we make three major contributions. First, we characterize the nature of privacy leaks on Twitter to gain an understanding of what types of private information people are revealing on it. We specifically analyze three types of leaks: divulging vacation plans, tweeting under the influence of alcohol, and revealing medical conditions. Second, using this characterization we build automatic classifiers to detect incriminating tweets for these three topics in real time in order to demonstrate the real threat posed to users by, e.g., burglars and law enforcement. Third, we characterize who leaks information and how. We study both self- incriminating primary leaks and secondary leaks that reveal sensitive information about others, as well as the prevalence of leaks in status updates and conversation tweets. We also conduct a cross-cultural study to investigate the prevalence of leaks in tweets originating from the United States, United Kingdom and Singapore. Finally, we discuss how our classification system can be used as a defense mechanism to alert users of potential privacy leaks.","cites":"36","conferencePercentile":"90"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"62f280e00f2cfdc846d43b1c82a238c7c524c2f3","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2011","title":"Pythia: a privacy aware, peer-to-peer network for social search","authors":"Shirin Nilizadeh, Naveed Alam, Nathaniel Husted, Apu Kapadia","author_ids":"2267110, 7254297, 2464101, 3163956","abstract":"Emerging \"live social search\" systems such as Aardvark.com allow users to pose questions to their social network in real time.

The success of these systems will be limited since users may avoid asking or answering questions related to sensitive topics such as health, political activism, or even innocuous questions which may make the querier seem ignorant.\n Since social search systems leverage the structure of the social network to better match askers and answerers, standard ideas that hide this structure such as \"connect to Aardvark via Tor\" fall short.

Individuals have strong expectations of privacy in their choice of information goods. These expectations are supported by both social norms and law. As a matter of practice, people may generally purchase and browse information goods without identifying themselves or the subject of their inquiry. People may pay in cash and avoid creating records that provide opportunities for third parties to learn of their information habits. Information providers that maintain records, such as libraries and bookstores, have staunchly defended their patrons' privacy, and indeed are often bound legally to demand due process of law before disclosing those records. Data holders can examine subpoenas for authenticity and cause, and challenge them in court before disclosing private information. Bookstores have done so in recent high-profile cases. [6][9] Libraries have developed elaborate policy mechanisms to ensure records are kept private, [1] and lobbied for laws protecting library records. U.S. law has also been protective of individuals' rights of privacy and free inquiry, grounding those protections in the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution. [4][5] Supplementing these constitutional protections, Congress and state legislatures have created a patchwork of industry-specific statutes that shield records of individual inquiry from disclosure to both public and private parties. For example, the Cable Television Privacy Act protects cable television subscribers from unfair data collection and use [3], and the Video Privacy Protection Act protects video rental records from release without a court order. [2] Laws in 48 states protect library records from release with without a court order. [1] These laws and business practices are generally based on Fair Information Practices, which mandate notice to consumers about data collection practices, the opportunity to discover and correct inaccurate records, and limitations on the use of data. [14] Using RFID to tag information goods creates new risks to personal privacy. Put simply, in the RFID-enabled world, anyone with an RFID reader can potentially discover individuals' informational preferences without their permission. When information goods can be \"interrogated\" over the radio, revealing the goods' identity or other information, neither the individual consumer nor the third-party record-holder, has the opportunity to prevent disclosure of the information on the RFID tag. All RFID operates through radio, which by its nature, anyone within range can receive. Current generation tags lack access control.

Similarly, a number of small businesses might want to use their recent point-of-sales data to cooperatively forecast future demand and thus make more informed decisions about inventory, capacity, employment, etc. These are simple examples of cooperative benchmarking and (respectively) forecasting that would benefit all participants as well as the public at large, as they would make it possible for participants to avail themselves of more precise and reliable data collected from many sources, to assess their own local performance in comparison to global trends, and to avoid many of the inefficiencies that currently arise because of having less information available for their decision-making. And yet, in spite of all these advantages, cooperative benchmarking and forecasting typically do not take place, because of the participants' unwillingness to share their information with others. Their reluctance to share is quite rational, and is due to fears of embarrassment, lawsuits, weakening their negotiating position (e.g., in case of over-capacity), revealing corporate performance and strategies, etc. The development and deployment of &#60;i>private&#60;/i> benchmarking and forecasting technologies would allow such collaborations to take place without revealing any participant's data to the others, reaping the benefits of collaboration while avoiding the drawbacks. Moreover, this kind of technology would empower smaller organizations who could then cooperatively base their decisions on a much broader information base, in a way that is today restricted to only the largest corporations. This paper is a step towards this goal, as it gives protocols for forecasting and benchmarking that reveal to the participants the desired answers yet do not reveal to any participant any other participant's private data.

Individuals tend to only visit a few locations with high frequency, and to move among them in a certain sequence reflecting their habits and daily routine. This predictability has to be taken into account in the design of location privacy preserving mechanisms (LPPMs) in order to effectively protect users when they expose their whereabouts to location-based services (LBSs) continuously. In this paper, we describe a method for creating LPPMs tailored to a user's mobility profile taking into her account privacy and quality of service requirements. By construction, our LPPMs take into account the sequential correlation across the user's exposed locations, providing the maximum possible trajectory privacy, i.e., privacy for the user's past, present location, and expected future locations. Moreover, our LPPMs are optimal against a strategic adversary, i.e., an attacker that implements the strongest inference attack knowing both the LPPM operation and the user's mobility profile.\n The optimality of the LPPMs in the context of trajectory privacy is a novel contribution, and it is achieved by formulating the LPPM design problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game between the user and the adversary. An additional benefit of our formal approach is that the design parameters of the LPPM are chosen by the optimization algorithm.","cites":"9","conferencePercentile":"86.53846154"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"2b23677fdfecee24605ebc2b622b6b73206ec832","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2014","title":"Reconciling Utility with Privacy in Genomics","authors":"Mathias Humbert, Erman Ayday, Jean-Pierre Hubaux, Amalio Telenti","author_ids":"2230149, 2898372, 1757221, 4524349","abstract":"Direct-to-consumer genetic testing makes it possible for everyone to learn their genome sequences. In order to contribute to medical research, a growing number of people publish their genomic data on the Web, sometimes under their real identities. However, this is at odds not only with their own privacy but also with the privacy of their relatives. The genomes of relatives being highly correlated, some family members might be opposed to revealing any of the family's genomic data. In this paper, we study the trade-off between utility and privacy in genomics. We focus on the most relevant kind of variants, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We take into account the fact that the SNPs of an individual contain information about the SNPs of his family members and that SNPs are correlated with each other. Furthermore, we assume that SNPs can have different utilities in medical research and different levels of sensitivity for individuals. We propose an obfuscation mechanism that enables the genomic data to be publicly available for research, while protecting the genomic privacy of the individuals in a family. Our genomic-privacy preserving mechanism relies upon combinatorial optimization and graphical models to optimize utility and meet privacy requirements. We also present an extension of the optimization algorithm to cope with the non-linear constraints induced by the correlations between SNPs. Our results on real data show that our proposed technique maximizes the utility for genomic research and satisfies family members' privacy constraints.","cites":"11","conferencePercentile":"96.15384615"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"5f9f9259c30753a8ca3c9a57d99171fcf5bcc3e7","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2004","title":"Conflict and combination in privacy policy languages","authors":"Adam Barth, John C.

This channel enables any recipient of one of these anonymous messages to send back one or more anonymous replies. Recipients who reply to different messages can not test whether two return channels are the same, and there-fore can not learn whether they are replying to the same person. Yet the fact that multiple recipients may send multiple replies through the <i>same</i> return channel helps defend against the counting attacks that defeated earlier proposals for return channels. In these attacks, an adversary traces the origin of a message by sending a specific number of replies and observing who collects the same number of messages. Our scheme resists these attacks because the replies sent by an attacker are mixed with other replies submitted by other recipients through the same return channel. Moreover, our protocol straightforwardly allows for replies to replies, etc. Our protocol is based upon a re-encryption mix network, and requires four times the amount of computation and communication of a basic mixnet.","cites":"17","conferencePercentile":"53.33333333"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"7cce6ce6a7e3dcd496346502bfd06b8ea457f170","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2004","title":"Defending email communication against profiling attacks","authors":"Philippe Golle, Ayman Farahat","author_ids":"2779068, 2097475","abstract":"We define message privacy against a &#60;i>profiling&#60;/i> adversary, whose goal is to classify a population of users into categories according to the messages they exchange.

Efforts to assemble these pieces often fail because of privacy concerns: subjects refuse to share their local knowledge of the graph. To assuage these privacy concerns, we propose reconstructing the whole graph privately, i.e., in a way that hides the correspondence between the nodes and edges in the graph and the real-life entities and relationships that they represent. We first model the privacy threats posed by the private reconstruction of a distributed graph. Our model takes into account the possibility that malicious nodes may report incorrect information about the graph in order to facilitate later attempts to de-anonymize the reconstructed graph. We then propose protocols to privately assemble the pieces of a graph in ways that mitigate these threats.

Frikken, Preethi Srinivas","author_ids":"1965461, 3329527","abstract":"In this paper we introduce a novel scheme for key management in social networks that is a first step towards the creation of a private social network. A social network graph (i.e., the graph of friendship relationships) is private and social networks are often used to share content, which may be private, amongst its users. In the status quo, the social networking server has access to both this graph and to all of the content, effectively requiring that it is a trusted third party. The goal of this paper is to produce a mechanism through which users can control how their content is shared with other users, without relying on a trusted third party to manage the social network graph and the users' data. The specific access control model considered here is that users will specify access policies based on distance in the social network; for example some content is visible to friends only, while other content is visible to friends of friends, etc. This access control is enforced via key management. That is for each user, there is a key that only friends should be able to derive, there is a key that both friends of the user and friends of friends can derive, etc. The proposed scheme enjoys the following properties: i) the scheme is asynchronous in that it does not require users to be online at the same time, ii) the scheme provides key indistinguishability (that is if a user is not allowed to derive a key according to the access policy, then that key is indistinguishable from a random value), iii) the scheme is efficient in terms of server storage and key derivation time, and iv) the scheme is collusion resistant.","cites":"10","conferencePercentile":"42.85714286"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"46ba61649de35403b04c581f61e7df399f573ec1","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2009","title":"A distortion-based metric for location privacy","authors":"Reza Shokri, Julien Freudiger, Murtuza Jadliwala, Jean-Pierre Hubaux","author_ids":"2520493, 1706269, 2235825, 1757221","abstract":"We propose a novel framework for measuring and evaluating location privacy preserving mechanisms in mobile wireless networks.

Our analysis suggests that if policymakers use removal of search by name as a privacy mechanism they should attempt to mitigate usability issues that can hinder legitimate use of public records databases.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"12.5"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"4c1f31e968b7e8d529e60380bc501e14788aa9ef","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2003","title":"I didn't buy it for myself' privacy and ecommerce personalization","authors":"Lorrie Faith Cranor","author_ids":"1699751","abstract":"Ecommerce personalization can help web sites build and retain relationships with customers, but it also raises a number of privacy concerns.

First, we provide a mathematical formulation of the Password Allocation (PA) problem and show that it is NP-complete with a reduction via the 3-Partition problem. We then study several special cases and show that the optimal solution is often a contiguous allocation -- i.e., similar accounts share passwords. Next, we evaluate several human- and machine-computable heuristics that have very good performance and produce solutions that are reasonably close to optimal. We find that the human-computable heuristics do not perform nearly as well as the machine-computable heuristics, however, they provide a useful and easy to follow set of guidelines for re-using passwords.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"48.27586207"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"e000054e16e37818b7f0c485f48163b4c0fcd39d","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2013","title":"No surprises: measuring intrusiveness of smartphone applications by detecting objective context deviations","authors":"Frances Zhang, Fuming Shih, Daniel J.

It captures each app's unique access patterns to sensitive personal data, including which types of behaviors and under which privacy-relevant usage contexts the data are collected. The second component is a new Intrusiveness Score that numerically measures out-of-context data collection, based on real data accesses gathered from empirical testing on 33 popular Android apps across 4 app categories. Specific attention is paid to the proportion of data accesses that occurs while the user is idle, raising the perceived level of intrusiveness and exposing the profiling potential of an app. Together, these components will help smartphone users decide whether to install an app because they will be able to easily and accurately assess the relative intrusiveness of apps. Our study also demonstrates that the Intrusiveness Score is helpful to compare apps that exhibit similar types of data accesses.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"34.48275862"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"2bfd15be8282fefa091cd438afde68bb73a8c25b","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2007","title":"Towards understanding user perceptions of authentication technologies","authors":"Laurie A.

Given the increasing use of Internet-scale distributed databases, exploring the spectrum between these two extremes is worthwhile. In this paper, we explore the degree to which query intension is leaked to remote data sources when a variety of existing query processing and view materialization techniques are used.

It operates by interfering with the protocol in which a reader communicates individually with other RFID tags. While inexpensive to manufacture in quantity, blockers are nonetheless special-purpose devices, and thus introduce level of complexity that may pose an obstacle to their deployment.\n We propose a variant on the blocker concept that we call &#60;i>soft blocking&#60;/i>. This involves software (or firmware) modules that offer a different balance of characteristics than ordinary blockers. Soft blocking offers somewhat weaker privacy enforcement that is essentially voluntary or internally auditable (much like P3P). It has the significant advantage, however, of relying on standard (or very slightly modified) RFID tags. Additionally, soft blocking offers the possibility of flexible privacy policies in which partial or scrubbed data is revealed about \"private\" tags, in lieu of the all-or-nothing policy enforced by a blocker.\n We show, moreover, how the correct functioning of a soft-blocker system may be rendered externally auditable with minor modifications to the basic tag-reading protocol.

We conducted a 1,505-participant online study to investigate Internet users' perceptions of OBA disclosures. The disclosures failed to clearly notify participants about OBA and inform them about their choices. Half of the participants remembered the ads they saw but only 12% correctly remembered the disclosure taglines attached to ads. When shown the disclosures again, the majority mistakenly believed that ads would pop up if they clicked on disclosures, and more participants incorrectly thought that clicking the disclosures would let them purchase advertisements than correctly understood that they could then opt out of OBA. \"AdChoices\", the most commonly used tagline, was particularly ineffective at communicating notice and choice.

Such a dual visibility of a friendship link may raise privacy threats. This is because both the users of a friendship link can separately control its visibility to other users and their preferences of sharing such a friendship link may not be consistent. Even if one of them conceals the friendship link from a third user, that third user may find the link through the other user's friend list. In addition, as most social network users allow their friends to see their friend lists, an adversary can exploit these inconsistent policies caused by users' conflicting preferences to identify and infer many of a targeted user's friends and even reconstruct the topology of an entire social network. In this paper, we propose, characterize and evaluate such an attack referred as the Friendship Identification and Inference (FII) attack. In an FII attack scenario, an adversary first accumulates the initial attack relevant information based on the friend lists visible to him in a social network. Then, he utilizes this information to identify and infer a target's friends using a random walk based approach. We formally define the attack and present the attack steps, the attack algorithm and various attack schemes. Our experimental results using three real social network datasets show that FII attacks are effective in inferring private friendship links of a target and predicting the topology of the social network. Currently, most popular social network systems, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Foursquare, are susceptible to FII attacks.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"11.53846154"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"4c5f479f2a7604796ae7f2a115b45863139c056c","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2006","title":"Scanning electronic documents for personally identifiable information","authors":"Tuomas Aura, Thomas A.

However, the users availing such services are concerned about their location privacy, in that they are forced to reveal their sensitive location information to untrusted third-parties. In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving approach, <i>Cover Locations,</i> which allows a user to access an LBS without revealing his/her actual location. Based on its current location, the user's device queries for a few specifically chosen surrounding locations and constructs the results corresponding to its location from the results obtained for each queried location. Since the user location <i>does not leave</i> the user's device - as either a latitude and longitude pair, or as an obfuscated region - the user is guaranteed very high level of privacy. The Cover Locations approach only requires minimal changes on the user's device and can be readily deployed by privacy-conscious users. An adversary, trying to identify the user location, can only resolve the location to few triangular regions and not to the actual location itself. We evaluate the privacy provided by Cover Locations based on the number of locations queried and the total area under the resolved triangular regions. We also ascertain the robustness of Cover Locations approach when the adversary has access to a short-term user history, employing machine learning techniques. Overall, our results show that the proposed solution, which requires minor computations without the need for any out-of-band information such as traffic densities in a region or the road network information, is superior to other client-based solutions.","cites":"5","conferencePercentile":"50"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"39f1dc941378d18cb82f9f8a37b9ccee90ea35aa","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2006","title":"A privacy-preserving interdomain audit framework","authors":"Adam J.

This poses a threat to privacy of such users, when apps indicating sensitive information, e.g., a gaming app showing a gambling problem, are the basis for profiling. In this paper, we propose a ProfileGuard, novel app-based obfuscation mechanism to remove the dominance (prevalence amongst the interest categories present in a user profile) of selected private user profile interest categories. We show, based on extensive experimental evaluation using 2700 Android apps during a 9 month test campaign, that the best trade-off between the level of effort required by the obfuscating system and the resulting privacy protection can be achieved by choosing the obfuscating apps based on <i>similarity</i> with user's existing apps (while ensuring that the selected apps belong to a non-private category). We implement a POC ProfileGuard app to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated obfuscation mechanism. We also provide insights into the broad Google AdMob profiling rules, showing that there is a deterministic mapping of individual apps to profile interests, that profiles based on multiple apps represent a union of individual app profiles and that there is a minimum level of activity necessary for AdMob to build a stable user profile. Finally, we show the resulting effect of obfuscation on the received ads, demonstrating that modifying user profiles to include a richer set of interests results in correspondingly more diverse received ads.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"11.53846154"},{"venue":"WPES","id":"2d2b1f9446e9b4cdb46327cda32a8d9621944e29","venue_1":"WPES","year":"2005","title":"Information revelation and privacy in online social networks","authors":"Ralph Gross, Alessandro Acquisti","author_ids":"1741233, 1683053","abstract":"Participation in social networking sites has dramatically increased in recent years.
