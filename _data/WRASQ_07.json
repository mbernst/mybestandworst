In certain situations these qualities must be traded off, sacrificing some qualities to some extent to improve others. This paper presents TOMCAD (a Tradeoff a Model with Capacity and Demand) for such tradeoffs and gives various properties and constraints that apply to such situations. With this approach, we show how to dynamically allocate system resources when demand changes with time, in a way that maintains required objectives for some service qualities. We demonstrate how this model applies to a family of distributed systems that trades off data consistency to gain availability.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"27.77777778"}]}
