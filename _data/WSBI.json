We develop a web mining based methodology that combines a classification procedure with discriminant analysis for analyzing click-stream data. Furthermore, we integrate managerial perspectives in investigating and interpreting customer website usage for determining RMS effectiveness. As a result, we are able to quantify the moderating effect of the website's structure and content on the effectiveness of Internet based relational marketing (RM) efforts. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated by investigating RMS effectiveness in the performance of a software developer's website. The results of our approach support website optimization and also enable customization for different relational marketing strategies.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"50"}]}
