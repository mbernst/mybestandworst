MGNG combines the state-of-the-art recursive temporal context of Merge Neu-ral Gas (MNG) with the incremental Growing Neural Gas (GNG) and enables thereby the analysis of unbounded and possibly infinite time series in an online manner. There is no need to define the number of neurons a priori and only constant parameters are used. MGNG utilizes a rather unknown entropy maximization strategy to control the creation of new neurons in order to focus on frequent sequence patterns. Experimental results demonstrate reduced time complexity compared to MNG while retaining similar accuracy in time series representation.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"63.88888889"}]}
