Consequently, embedded-hardware could prevent us from recognizing all of them by ourselves. Furthermore , wireless connection among embedded devices also makes users not have a clear grasp of which kind of application is running among them. This kind of user's unawareness should make the speed of embedded ubiquitous systems to the home slow. To overcome above mentioned issues, we have developed uBlocks that enables visual handmade composition of software component application among heterogeneous devices by users themselves.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"25"}]}
