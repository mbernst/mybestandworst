Flow table based on hash is one of the bottlenecks. In this paper, we measure the characteristics of IPv6 address and propose an entropy based revision hash algorithm, which can produce a better distribution within acceptable time. Moreover, we use a hierarchical hash strategy to reduce hash table lookup times further more even in extreme cases.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"50"}]}
