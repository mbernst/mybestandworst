In this paper, we propose a dynamic cooperative relaying protocol, termed dynamic block-cycling (DBC) protocol, for a UWA linear network. Considering large channel variations, we assume one node can hear from not only its direct but also several remote neighbors. A transmission package with multiple blocks is taken as one relay unit, where an erasure-correction code and an error-correction code are used for inter-block encoding and intra-block encoding, respectively. During the relaying process, each node in the proposed protocol starts relaying immediately after it decodes the relayed message, hence a reduced end-to-end transmission latency can be achieved. Meanwhile, to avoid the overhead for relay cooperation, the relays' transmissions are cyclically synchronized, such that in each time slot, the blocks arriving at the downstream receiving nodes from all the upstream transmitting nodes have the same block index. Numerical results showthat for a one-shot transmission, the proposed protocol achieves a reduced end-to-end delay relative to existing protocols while maintaining a decent outage performance.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"78.57142857"},{"venue":"WUWNet","id":"4500de12f8619f41447568f46588029a4b8bfd09","venue_1":"WUWNet","year":"2011","title":"Scheduled MAC in beacon overlay networks for underwater localization and time-synchronization","authors":"Wouter van Kleunen, Nirvana Meratnia, Paul J.

Due to the low propagation speed of the sound, the relative motion between the transmitter and receiver can result in serious Doppler effect. Even if both of the platforms stay still, the multipath signals along different eigenrays vary in angles of arrival, hence the radial velocities. Such Doppler velocities brings different time compressions or dilations to the multipath signals. In addition, as the signal bandwidth is usually comparable to the center frequency, it is more appropriate for the underwater acoustic channels to be modeled as wideband channels. In this paper, the parameter estimation of the wideband time-varying underwater acoustic channels is investigated. Linear frequency modulation signals are used as the training sequences, and the fractional Fourier transform is the key of the estimation algorithm. The communication scenario, with a fixed transmitter and a moving receiver, is built by the Bellhop software.

The medium is particularly challenging for the transmission of acoustic and optical signals. Thus, the true performance of a transmitter/receiver system can be evaluated only in the water. It would then appear that UW research be inevitably associated with a testbed. However, this is not always the case because UW testbeds are difficult to set up, calibrate and instrument. The purpose of the recent NSF CRI Ocean-TUNE project is precisely that of deploying inexpensive UW testbeds accessible by the Community. UCLA, as a participant in the Ocean-TUNE project, has recognized that one UW testbed cannot fit all applications and therefore has been developing WaterCom, a multilevel testing platform consisting of three testbeds - small, medium and large scale. The small testbed is deployed in a tank, with two modems; it is used for point-to-point communications at close range. It is instrumented for remote access and allows the testing of variable TX power values with different obstacles, reflected rays absorption and water purity values (for optical experiments). The medium scale testbed, deployed at the Marina del Rey UCLA boathouse, will enable remotely monitored experiments of MAC and network protocols with three nodes, one of them mobile. The large scale open water testbed is deployed in the Catalina channel. It will employ OFDM Modems as well as small submersible, mobile platforms. WaterCom will enable two types of experiments: environment measurements, like subsurface currents, presence of deposits in the water, etc, and; network protocol and application measurements in the open water.

This paper investigates the feasibility of such a network application by evaluating the performance of two recent pressure routing protocols: Depth Based Routing and HydroCast for delivering sensed data from a depth-restricted layer of nodes. Previous work on these protocols has only focused on low-traffic scenarios with infrequent broadcasts made by nodes throughout the network, or with only one source node. A key contribution of this paper is an investigation of the effect that current drift has on networking. The performance of the routing protocols over time is measured, under a modified 3D Meandering Current Mobility model that takes into account lower current speeds with increased depth. Results show that even in a slow-moving coastal current, packet delivery in an initially dense network becomes unviable within 3 hours of drift.

However, there exist two fundamental challenges to underwater synchronization, namely, large propagation delays and substantial node mobility during the synchronization process. While existing underwater time sync solutions have been proposed to address these challenges, they rely on heavy signaling, which is undesirable due to high energy costs. In this paper, we introduce a powerful new approach that incorporates physical layer information, namely an estimate of the Doppler shift. Large Doppler shift has been identified as a major challenge to underwater communication, and current systems implement sophisticated solutions to estimate and track such Doppler shift for each data exchange. While an impediment to communication, we will show that the Doppler shift contains highly useful information that can be leveraged to greatly improve time synchronization. Specifically, it provides an indication of the relative motion between nodes. Our new protocol, called D-sync, strategically exploits this feature to address the timing uncertainty due to node mobility. As such, D-sync can handle substantial mobility, without making any assumptions about the underlying motion, and without extensive signaling. Simulation results show that D-sync significantly outperforms existing time synchronization both in terms of accuracy and energy.","cites":"11","conferencePercentile":"94.73684211"},{"venue":"WUWNet","id":"657ef643f137ebdf15cdfbe11b6c199b2a558e1f","venue_1":"WUWNet","year":"2009","title":"Low-cost medium-range optical underwater modem: short paper","authors":"Feng Lu, Sammy Lee, Jeffrey Mounzer, Curt Schurgers","author_ids":"6923138, 8569300, 1735059, 1697660","abstract":"Enhancing underwater instruments with networking capabilities is opening up exciting new opportunities for remote ocean exploration.

Inspiration for electrostatic sensing is provided by the diverse species of fish that use passive and induced electric fields for hunting, defense, localization, and communication. Designing an electrostatic sensor is not without its challenges. Hardware filter and amplifier design are analyzed since the high impedance signals require high gain and steps must be taken to minimize noise, maximizing signal to noise ratio.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"58.82352941"},{"venue":"WUWNet","id":"b3dff440fcaab104c25487d38c24730fc3bd70ed","venue_1":"WUWNet","year":"2009","title":"Software-defined underwater acoustic networking platform","authors":"Dustin Torres, Jonathan Friedman, Thomas Schmid, Mani B.

To try and cope with the challenges of the channel many MAC protocols and PHY layer techniques have been proposed. In this paper we present a research platform that allows developers to easily implement and compare their protocols in an underwater network and configure them at runtime. We have built our platform using widely supported software that has been successfully used in terrestrial radio and network development. The flexibility of development tools such as software defined radio have provided the ability for rapid growth in the community. Our platform adapts some of these tools to work well with the underwater environment while maintaining flexibility, ultimately providing an end-to-end networking approach for underwater acoustic development.","cites":"22","conferencePercentile":"93.75"},{"venue":"WUWNet","id":"070aefe17c179be711c9f2f9b7c4e588bb484ed1","venue_1":"WUWNet","year":"2012","title":"Realtime in-ocean submerged collision avoidance via biomimetic electrostatic imaging","authors":"Jonathan Friedman, Henry Herman, Newton Truong, Young H.

BEI uses conductivity and Coulomb's law rather than electromagnetic or acoustic (SONAR) principles to provide more rapid imaging at substantially reduced output powers making the technique perfect for Uncrewed Underwater Vehicles (UUV) seeking to align for docking, avoid obstacles while traversing, perform relative station keeping (formation management), or track/follow a target object. It is demonstrated to work in real-time against the type of short-range targets that pose a collision threat.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"21.42857143"}]}
