It also has the ability to generate operators during planning from Web pages. For understanding a concept, it is a useful way to utilize a search engine for gathering relevant Web pages. However the gathered Web pages are fractions of knowledge explaining a target concept directly. To cope with this problem, we propose navigation planning to generate a sequence of Web pages by which a user systematically understand a concept.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"22.43589744"},{"venue":"WWW Posters","id":"84d088dc2ee25c196881347aee42d03cfe8c3cac","venue_1":"WWW Posters","year":"2001","title":"Improving Web Site's Accessibility","authors":"John D.

Mobile agents are an effective choice for many applications to improve latency and band-width of client-server applications and to reduce vulnerability to network disconnection. In this paper, we propose MiLog, a logic-based mobile agent framework for constructing intelligent information agents. In the framework, inference and planning process of an agent is written in a compact logic program. A new generation logic program execution engine provides strong migration capability with reasonable execution speed. The framework has been used to develop a web-based decision support system 'Bidding-Bot'.","cites":"7","conferencePercentile":"81.41025641"},{"venue":"WWW Posters","id":"45a6044f143f55e6c9df1f541f2132dfcef6afb1","venue_1":"WWW Posters","year":"2001","title":"Classification Pruning for Web-request Prediction","authors":"Ian Tian Yi Li, Qiang Yang, Ke Wang","author_ids":"3346716, 1733090, 1751643","abstract":"N-gram and repeating pattern based prediction rules have been used for next-web request prediction.

Due to size constraints, in many circumstances speech is the most desirable mode of input. We have developed a system for spoken query based web navigation and searching. The spoken query is recorded by a lightweight client and transmitted to a server where the computationally intensive continuous speech recognition and query execution are performed. Lightweight clients have been developed that can either be a small downloadable Active X component running within a browser or a small application running on a handheld PocketPC. Through these interfaces, users can search for contents in an Encarta encyclopedia, content of a particular website, or navigate to popular websites.","cites":"5","conferencePercentile":"75"},{"venue":"WWW Posters","id":"4791b68de57e642a081fe095f92e296c6c069690","venue_1":"WWW Posters","year":"2001","title":"Towards a Framework to Effective Web-based Distributed Learning","authors":"Tim J.

A web community is a collection of web pages created by individuals or any kind of associations that have a common interest on a specific topic. In this paper, we propose a technique to create a web community chart, that connects related web communities, from thousands of seed pages. This allows the user to navigate through related web communities, and can be used for a `What's Related Community' service that provides not only the web community including a given page but also related web communities. Our technique is based on a related page algorithm that gives related pages to a given page using only link analysis. We show that the algorithm can be used for creating the chart by applying the algorithm to each seed, then using similarities of the results to classify seeds into clusters and to deduce their relationships. We perform experiments to create a web community chart of companies and organizations from thousands of seed pages. First, we improve the precision of an existing related page algorithm, Companion, and evaluated the improved version, Companion-, by an user study. Then the chart is created using Companion-. The result chart consists of web communities including related pages, and paths between related web communities. From the chart, we can find many web communities of companies classified by their category of business, and relationships between the communities.","cites":"53","conferencePercentile":"98.71794872"},{"venue":"WWW Posters","id":"b907ead3489e447c20fd549f5e739db257af330f","venue_1":"WWW Posters","year":"2001","title":"Who is SMILing on the Web?","authors":"Gal Ashour, Byron Dom, John Golden, Jan Pieper, Savitha Srinivasan, Dick C.

The indexing challenges offered by the unstructured, spatio-temporal nature of media together with the lack of universal media standards largely accounts for this. The W3 Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) [6] standard partially addresses these issues with the support for creation and presentation of complex streaming media across multiple formats. Our focus here is the characterization of web pages that are SMILing or streaming complex media presentations. Since exhaustive enumeration of web pages is impractical, we take a sampling approach. Experimental validation shows that less than 1% of web pages contain links to streaming media, of which 65% is RealMedia, 11% is Windows Media, 2% is SMIL and 22% is other formats. We also investigate the distribution of links from web pages to streaming media and find it skewed to small numbers of both in (to media files) and out (from web pages) links. METHODOLOGY We base our estimates for the web on a set of 60 million pages whereas the latest estimate of web size of which we are aware [2] put the size at approximately 1 billion pages. To gain confidence in our estimates we performed the following sampling experiment. We detect web pages that link to or embed streaming media on a set of 2 million pages, and then again on the entire set of 60 million pages. Web pages that link to or embed streaming media were found to be of the following types: Static page: This type of page contains the name and extension of the media file and its location. Client-side dynamic page: This type of page dynamically creates a browser page that contains media links using a scripting language Server-side dynamic page: This type of page may return a page that links to streaming media in response to user click. We view the detection of streaming media as binary classification, which can be associated with a function where are f(x) = y x 1 , x 2 , ..x d the features in a given document x. Thus a document is represented by and represents discrete target values x = (x 1 , x ‚Ä¶","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"51.28205128"},{"venue":"WWW Posters","id":"65cd6f77aaa3ad2180b782ef277ff9002d56e863","venue_1":"WWW Posters","year":"2001","title":"Auditing for Accessibility","authors":"Lorna Gibson, David Sloan, Peter Gregor, Paul Booth","author_ids":"2771841, 1746921, 3182217, 1687671","abstract":"The paper discusses recent web Accessibility Audits produced by the authors [8] ‚Äì audits that have the dual aims of raising accessibility levels of the subject sites and the general awareness of accessible design principles.

It also allows these thin clients to access resources and information on the internet and various networks. iMobile implements three key abstractions: devlet, infolet, and applet. A devlet is a driver attached to iMobile that receives and sends messages through a particular protocol for mobile devices. An infolet hosted on iMobile uses a particular access method to provide an abstract view of an information space. An applet implements service or application logic by processing information from various infolets. The foundation of iMobile, the let engine, implements the basic framework for maintaining applets, devlets and infolets, supports user and device profiles for personalization and transcoding, and invokes proper applets and infolets to answer requests from a devlet. The iMobile architecture allows new access devices and protocols to be added to its framework without changes in the service logic. iMobile effectively provides a personal agent on the network that enables a user to have mobile access to the information and services available, without being limited by where the user is or whatever communication or device protocol is available.","cites":"6","conferencePercentile":"77.56410256"},{"venue":"WWW Posters","id":"199cafbd431676650ef85d2d56cfed003d710ea4","venue_1":"WWW Posters","year":"2001","title":"Crawling the Hidden Web","authors":"Sriram Raghavan, Hector Garcia-Molina","author_ids":"2736218, 1695250","abstract":"Current-day crawlers retrieve content from the publicly in-dexable Web, i.e., the set of web pages reachable purely by following hypertext links, ignoring search forms and pages that require authorization or prior registration.
