BCIs record and process brain activity in order to extract command which can be used for communication, control. This technology usually implements bio-feedback (or neuro-feedback) which is a tool that allows to the patient/user to verify the correct use of the system. Biofeedback can be also used like an indicator of rehabilitation status of a neuromuscular sub-system.Usually BCI researcher focuses on performance and reliability, but since the system should be applied in everyday life, usability, comfortability and wearability are mandatory.

In particular, we study how wrist-mounted inertial sensors such as those in smart watches and fitness trackers, can track steering wheel usage and inputs. Identifying steering wheel usage helps mobile device detect driving and reduce distractions. Tracking steering wheel turning angles can improve vehicle motion tracking by mobile devices and help identify unsafe driving. The approach relies on motion features that allow distinguishing steering from other confounding hand movements. Once steering wheel usage is detected, it also use wrist rotation measurements to infer steering wheel turning angles. Our preliminary experiments show that the technique is 98.9% accurate in detecting driving and can estimate turning angles with average error within two degrees.","cites":"5","conferencePercentile":"100"},{"venue":"WearSys@MobiSys","id":"4f273d0f8570a87980815c02dc237f6f9fe77fb4","venue_1":"WearSys@MobiSys","year":"2015","title":"Colorizer: Smart Glasses Aid for the Colorblind","authors":"Andrei Popleteev, Nicolas Louveton, Rod McCall","author_ids":"1808655, 3102091, 1799513","abstract":"We present a smart glasses application for helping colorblind people to distinguish problematic colors in daily life.

The identification of landmarks is an essential skill required for the cognitive mapping and spatial representation. Since 2013 we have been worked on the investigation of wearables for supporting landmark identification and, thus, the cognitive mapping by the blind.

The method employs the two-node model to simulate the change of core and skin temperature by calculating heat exchange between core, skin and environment and heat production in the body. The method determines the optimal parameter set representing individual thermoregulation function and physical feature through exhaustive simulation based on monitored skin temperature, ambient temperature and humidity, and heart rate.\n We have evaluated our method through totally 94 hours of real experiments.

While the consumer market is pushing them particularly as activity or heart rate trackers, their adoption in healthcare is still restricted to few cases, primarily due to their limited accuracy and reliability. An interesting field of application is the jump performance assessment. It is frequently used by therapists to estimate neuromuscular imbalances, since it helps to monitor training progress in athletes or injured patients. Measurements are typically captured with accurate but expensive instrumentation (e.g. force plates). In this work, we propose the use of a versatile low-cost wearable device equipped with inertial sensors for the evaluation of jump height, which can be easily employed at home. We consider two categories of jumps, the counter-movement jump (a single vertical jump) and the plyometric jump (the fast repetition of 4 jumps). The proposed approach, after an initialization phase, uses gyroscope data to continuously track the orientation of the device and align it with the vertical plane and the accelerometer data to estimate the jump trajectory. To validate the system, we collected 200 jumps performed with our device and the Myotest and we observed a mean difference of 0.7 cm (max. 1.9 cm) for the counter-movement jumps and 0.6 (max. 2.1 cm) for the plyometric jumps.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"28.57142857"},{"venue":"WearSys@MobiSys","id":"48683ba0a58411bb33b941f3edc65ad230cb17fb","venue_1":"WearSys@MobiSys","year":"2015","title":"Smartphone Usage Restriction During Crossing Roads and Railways","authors":"Tsubasa Saeki, Kaori Fujinami","author_ids":"2664178, 2272050","abstract":"In late years, a number of people walk carelessly while continuing watching a smartphone screen, which often causes fatal accidents.
