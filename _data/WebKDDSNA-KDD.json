We describe the data available and investigate several analytical approaches to address the challenge of understanding \"how innovation happens\" and to facilitate the success of future Jams. We demonstrate the social network structure of data and its time dependence, and discuss the results of both supervised and unsupervised learning applied to this data.","cites":"12","conferencePercentile":"50"}]}
