For some people, the ability to adjust the audio volume may be sufficient. For others, translation to a signed language may be more appropriate. For others still, access to text alternatives may be the best solution. Because of these differences , it is important for researchers in Web accessibility to understand that people with hearing impairments may have very different cultural-linguistic traditions and personal backgrounds. People with hearing impairments form a disability group very different than other disability groups. Because a large segment uses signed languages which are distinct from the spoken language used around them, the accessibility needs of this group involves language translation. In this section, we provide basic information about those who are hearing impaired and the distinct subgroups of deaf and hard of hearing. 2.1 Models of Hearing Impairment The hearing impaired disability group is very diverse and not necessarily of one mind. It helps to think of the three models of disability: (i) medical model, (ii)rehabilitation model, and (iii) social model (Oliver 1990).","cites":"6","conferencePercentile":"100"}]}
