Combinatorial auctions provide suitable mechanisms for efficient allocation of resources to self-interested attendees. On the other hand, efficient resource allocation is also becoming crucial in many computer systems that should manage resources efficiently. Considering ubiquitous computing scenarios, the ability to complete an auction within a fine-grained time period without loss of allocation efficiency is in strong demand. Furthermore, to achieve such scenarios, it is very important to handle a large number of bids in an auction. In general, the optimal winner determination problem of a combinatorial auction is NP-hard. Thus, much work focuses on tackling the computational costs for winner determination. In this paper, we show that our approximation algorithms provide sufficient quality of winners for auctions that have a large number of bids on hard time constraints. Furthermore, we compare and discuss desirable properties of such approximation algorithms to be embedded in application systems.","cites":"5","conferencePercentile":"77.77777778"},{"venue":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","id":"db6ccc95dea189304fc5fd080f888f76778241d8","venue_1":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","year":"2006","title":"Temporal multi-page summarization","authors":"Adam Jatowt, Mitsuru Ishizuka","author_ids":"1774986, 1687719","abstract":"With the increasing popularity of the Web, efficient approaches to the information overload are becoming more necessary. Summarization of web pages aims at detecting the most important contents from pages so that a user can obtain a compact version of a web document or a group of pages. Traditionally, summaries are constructed on static snapshots of web pages. However, web pages are dynamic objects that can change their contents anytime. In this paper, we discuss the research on temporal multi-document summarization in the Web. We analyze the temporal contents of topically related collections of web pages monitored for certain time intervals. The contents derived from the temporal versions of web documents are summarized to provide information on hot topics and popular events in the collection. We propose two summarization methods that use changing and static contents of web pages downloaded at defined time intervals. The first uses a sliding window mechanism and the second is based on analyzing the time series of the document frequencies of terms. Additionally, we introduce a novel sentence selection algorithm designed for time-dependent scenarios such as temporal summarization.","cites":"7","conferencePercentile":"61.53846154"},{"venue":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","id":"dc2aba080f816ab996e283eca33ab96b20213239","venue_1":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","year":"2005","title":"Hybrid negotiation for resource coordination in multiagent systems","authors":"Xin Li, Leen-Kiat Soh","author_ids":"1705796, 1742521","abstract":"In this paper, we present a coordination approach to resource allocation problem in multiagent systems. Agents adaptively coordinate resources among themselves to handle resource shortage crises resulted from events they encounter in dynamic, uncertain, real-time, and noisy environments. The coordination approach is implemented with a hybrid negotiation mechanism. The hybrid negotiation mechanism combines competitive and cooperative negotiations. In competitive negotiations, agents are self-interested and negotiate to maximize their individual performance; while in cooperative negotiations, agents are altruistic and negotiate to find a solution to help others. We define a hybrid negotiation model based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture of agents, and implement the model with a specific negotiation protocol and strategy. To help agents negotiate better, we equip agents with profiling and learning capabilities. Agents profile others and learn the negotiation experience to make decisions on with whom to negotiate, and how to negotiate. We have implemented a multiagent system for coordinating the CPU resource allocation among agents based on the hybrid negotiation mechanism and conducted a series of experiments. The experimental results show that our coordination approach to resource allocation is able to reduce resource shortage crises, make the multiagent system adaptive to the variation of load, and provide efficient resource coordination among autonomous agents. The experimental results also show that the hybrid negotiation mechanism is stable for resource coordination in complex environments.","cites":"5","conferencePercentile":"71.42857143"},{"venue":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","id":"d09f23a5a3ca9daa91309bd41224f072c7e67533","venue_1":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","year":"2014","title":"Agent-based problem solving methods in Big Data environment","authors":"Hao Lan Zhang, Hoong Chuin Lau","author_ids":"1787278, 1809379","abstract":"This special issue particularly focuses on using agent-based methods to solve the complex computational problems arising in Big Data environments.

Our motivating hypothesis is that to deal with dynamic and unpredictable environments it is important to have agents that can learn the right situations in which to attempt to coordinate and the right method to use in those situations. This hypothesis is evaluated empirically, using reinforcement based algorithms, in a grid-world scenario in which a) an agent's predictions about the other agents in the environment are approximately correct and b) an agent can not correctly predict the others' behaviour.

We are interested in how this behavior changes, and how it affects other stake-holders in web search. We analyze one year of web-search and news-search logs, looking at query bursts from multiple perspectives. First, we adopt the perspective of search engine users, describing changes in their effort and interest while searching. Second, we adopt the perspective of news providers by comparing web search and news search query bursts. Third, we look at the burst from the perspective of content providers. We study the conditions under which content providers can \" ride \" a wave of increased interest on a topic, and obtain a share of the user's increased attention. We do so by identifying the class of queries that can be considered as an opportunity for content providers that are \" latecomers \" for a query, in the sense of not being among the first to write about its topic. We also present a simple model for predicting the click share content providers could obtain if they decide to provide content about these queries.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"80"},{"venue":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","id":"5462084b51f4aa71186a602ca1c3badd1fe28ffd","venue_1":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","year":"2007","title":"Utilization of intelligent agents for supporting citizens in their access to e-government services","authors":"Pasquale De Meo, Giovanni Quattrone, Giorgio Terracina, Domenico Ursino","author_ids":"1709372, 1742046, 1743359, 1694982","abstract":"This paper aims at studying the utilization of Intelligent Agents for supporting citizens to access e-government services.

This rule can also be directly applied to the lives of organizations. Any organization of non-trivial size, scope, life expectancy or function, is destined to change. An organization without the ability to transition is not robust, evolvable or adaptable within its environment. These basic preconditions to human organizations must also hold in viable agent organizations. To model an adaptable agent organization, the capability must be present to transition from one state to the next over the life of the organization. The organization model must include not only the structural objects, but also the ability to facilitate change. The ability to change empowers the organization to transition from one state to the next, over its useful life. To enable transition, we must formally capture and define what triggers an organization transition. In this paper, we will define the properties to formally model the ability of an adaptable organization to transition throughout its useful life. The properties will be instantiated, using an implemented system, allowing the evaluation of internal and external stimuli to cause transition to the organization. These transitions will be evaluated from several perspectives to determine their effectivity on basis of design and use.","cites":"3","conferencePercentile":"66.66666667"},{"venue":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","id":"34a7a4a3296986e2fd5ae1f932104f8e690608d1","venue_1":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","year":"2008","title":"Optimal combinatorial electricity markets","authors":"Yoseba K.

In particular, we study a multi-round combinatorial auction that is built on a general equilibrium framework. We adopt the general equilibrium framework and the particular combinatorial auction design from the literature, and we investigate the benefits and the limitation of time-period aggregation when demand-side uncertainties are introduced. By using simulation experiments on a real-life resource allocation problem from a container port, we show that, under stochastic conditions, the performance variation of the process decreases as the time frame length (time frames are obtained by aggregating time periods) increases. This is achieved without causing substantial deterioration in the mean performance. The main driver for the increase in robustness is that longer time frames result in allocations where resources are assigned in longer contiguous time blocks. The resulting resource continuity allows bidders to shift schedules upon realization of stochasticity. To demonstrate the generality of the notion that resource continuity increases allocation robustness, we perform further experiments on a decentralized variant of the classical job shop scheduling problem. The experiment results demonstrate similar benefits.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"33.33333333"},{"venue":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","id":"13093fb97f4feb1226980119e6fc1798eef06117","venue_1":"Web Intelligence and Agent Systems","year":"2007","title":"Building application ontologies from descriptions of Semantic Web Services","authors":"Xia Wang, Manfred Hauswirth, Tomas Vitvar, Doug Foxvog","author_ids":"3517895, 1733076, 1760758, 2559510","abstract":"Different ontologies used in semantic web services fields raise numerous interoperation and communication problems with respect to service discovery, composition, and execution.
