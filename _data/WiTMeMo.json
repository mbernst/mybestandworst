This understanding of performance, in turn, results in robust protocol design. In this paper, we present an experimental study of multimedia traffic performance in mesh networks. We evaluate the performance of video and voice traffic through multi-hop wireless paths and study the capacity of the mesh network. We also investigate the impact of different traffic and network characteristics on application performance. The impact of different wireless network interface card configurations is examined, followed by our suggestions for how to improve performance. We believe our study is beneficial for both wireless network capacity planning and robust protocol design for wireless applications and services. Other researchers can also draw upon our traffic measurement experience for their own mesh testbed experiments.","cites":"28","conferencePercentile":"71.42857143"},{"venue":"WiTMeMo","id":"1d13fda342ba84c060f3864498644a02bb47ce5a","venue_1":"WiTMeMo","year":"2005","title":"A Measurement Study of Path Capacity in 802.11b-based Wireless Networks","authors":"Tony Sun, Guang Yang, Ling-Jyh Chen, M.

In this paper, we implement AdHoc Probe, a recently proposed path capacity estimation tool specially designed for the multi-hop ad hoc wireless environment. We present an implementation of AdHoc Probe in Linux; discuss challenges in its deployment, and solutions to the various system issues encountered. We also evaluate the behavior/effectiveness of AdHoc Probe in various testbed setups; including an interfered setting that cannot be simulated. Experiment results validate the workings of AdHoc Probe and offer insights into how the capacity of a wireless path changes in real wireless environments. Our efforts provide a basis for realistic results that can be of assistance in activities such as capacity planning, protocol design, performance analysis, and etc.","cites":"14","conferencePercentile":"28.57142857"},{"venue":"WiTMeMo","id":"1167cacc2764416be7c8d3592f329e95ad8313f8","venue_1":"WiTMeMo","year":"2005","title":"An Accurate Technique for Measuring the Wireless Side of Wireless Networks","authors":"Jihwang Yeo, Moustafa Youssef, Ashok K. Agrawala","author_ids":"2769855, 1780388, 1770467","abstract":"Wireless monitoring (WM) is a passive approach for capturing wireless-side traffic with rich MAC/PHY layer information. WM can suffer, however, from low capture performance, i.e., high measurement loss, due to the unreliable wireless medium. In this paper, we experimentally show that WM can perform reliable and accurate measurements on wireless traffic, in actual, non-ideal channel conditions.We demonstrate how to increase capture performance by merging traces from multiple monitoring devices. This merging enables WM to capture over 99% of the IP layer traffic and over 97% of the MAC/PHY frames in a controlled experiment. Our results indicate that WM enables reliable analysis of the collected traces, and should encourage the wireless research community to use this technique for a wide variety of research areas, such as traffic analysis, user mobility and handoff analysis, and MAC/PHY anomaly detection.","cites":"33","conferencePercentile":"85.71428571"}]}
