Traditional IP networking and wireless protocols tend to perform poorly. In this paper, we propose Content Centric Networking (CCN) for emergency wireless ad hoc environments. CCN is a novel communication architecture capable to access and retrieve content by name. This new approach achieves scalability, security, and efficient network resource management in large scale disaster recovery and battlefield networks. Existing Internet CCN schemes cannot be directly applied to wireless mobile ad hoc networks due to different environments and specific limitations. Thus, we must extend the CCN architecture by introducing features and requirements especially designed for disruptive networks. We prove feasibility and performance of the new design via implementation and experimentation.","cites":"32","conferencePercentile":"100"},{"venue":"Wireless Days","id":"f0626707fac116eddd35531919893d08c62ebfab","venue_1":"Wireless Days","year":"2013","title":"Integration of WSNs into enterprise systems based on semantic physical business entities","authors":"Matthias Thoma, Klaus Sperner, Torsten Braun, Carsten Magerkurth","author_ids":"1918273, 3201789, 1680089, 1711753","abstract":"—Internet of Things based systems are anticipated to gain widespread use in industrial applications. Standardization efforts, like 6LoWPAN and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) have made the integration of wireless sensor nodes possible using Internet technology and web-like access to data (RESTful service access). While there are still some open issues, the interoperability problem in the lower layers can now be considered solved from an enterprise software vendors' point of view. One possible next step towards integration of real-world objects into enterprise systems and solving the corresponding interoperability problems at higher levels is to use semantic web technologies. We introduce an abstraction of real-world objects, called Semantic Physical Business Entities (SPBE), using Linked Data principles. We show that this abstraction nicely fits into enterprise systems, as SPBEs allow a business object centric view on real-world objects, instead of a pure device centric view. The interdependencies between how currently services in an enterprise system are used and how this can be done in a semantic real-world aware enterprise system are outlined, arguing for the need of semantic services and semantic knowledge repositories. We introduce a lightweight query language, which we use to perform a quantitative analysis of our approach to demonstrate its feasibility.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"76.38888889"},{"venue":"Wireless Days","id":"0986c227b4632b6c3bf2d1d3cdd5ed036d59705e","venue_1":"Wireless Days","year":"2012","title":"Opportunistic forwarding throughout customers or sellers in shopping mall environments","authors":"Adriano Galati, Karim Djemame, Chris Greenhalgh","author_ids":"3352167, 1748771, 1714469","abstract":"—In this paper, we seek to improve understanding of human mobility patterns in environments having definite and highly organized structure, such as shopping malls. We present a method to identify individuals expressing different mobility patterns. Besides, to understand better the role of groups of message carriers expressing different mobility patterns, we performed simulations of a derivative of the Epidemic protocol with real-world mobility traces, which distinguishes between two groups of carriers, and entrusts messages through either one or the other. We discuss the implications of our results and make recommendations to guide the design of ad-hoc forwarding algorithms for delay tolerant mobile ad-hoc networks in shopping mall environments and to help modeling realistic simulation scenarios.","cites":"2","conferencePercentile":"75"},{"venue":"Wireless Days","id":"67d244b1b70c3bd7c6a7d35f0218b27618894149","venue_1":"Wireless Days","year":"2010","title":"Randomized channel hopping scheme for anti-jamming communication","authors":"Eun-Kyu Lee, Soon-Young Oh, Mario Gerla","author_ids":"2563601, 1713739, 8467438","abstract":"—Jamming attacks have been recently studied as wireless security threats disrupting reliable RF communication in a wireless network. By emitting noise-like signals arbitrarily on the shared wireless medium, a jammer can easily disturb the network. Countermeasures such as Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum enable nodes to avoid the jamming attacks by hopping over multiple channels. However, these solutions require pre-key establishment before data transmission, which in turns introduces several constraints. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel Quorum Rendezvous Channel Hopping (QRCH) scheme 1. Nodes are able to hop over random channels independently, bypassing the need for pre-key establishment. Furthermore, by using a quorum system, nodes are guaranteed to meet within a bounded time to exchange pending messages. The scheme also enables nodes to transmit packets to multiple receivers simultaneously. We validate the proposed scheme via extensive simulations and present its robustness and efficiency.","cites":"11","conferencePercentile":"83.92857143"},{"venue":"Wireless Days","id":"032ecaae6daf14a243d98f6cd1a55476447cb405","venue_1":"Wireless Days","year":"2010","title":"Urban-X: Towards distributed channel assignment in cognitive multi-radio mesh networks","authors":"Wooseong Kim, Andreas Kassler, Marco Di Felice, Mario Gerla","author_ids":"5732050, 1753559, 8129554, 8467438","abstract":"—Researches about multi-radio mesh networks have mostly focused on channel allocation under internal interference. However, the deployment of WMNs in unlicensed bands of dense urban areas imposes many challenges regarding coexistence with residential access points. In this paper, we propose Urban-X, which is a first attempt towards a new architecture for Multi-Radio Cognitive Mesh Networks. We develop a novel channel assignment that reflects channel and residential traffic state of external users to maximize network throughput. We evaluate our approach using an enhancement of the ns-2 simulator.

TR-MAC is an energy-efficient preamble sampling based MAC protocol for low power WSNs suitable for low data rate and low duty cycle scenario. However, low data rate is not always maintained in wireless sensor networks which often have to deal with event-driven scenarios where a sudden event rapidly increases traffic load within the network. In this paper we propose a traffic-adaptive duty cycle adaptation mechanism in order to provide responsiveness to traffic rate variations for TR-MAC protocol. This mechanism increases throughput and decreases packet delay while maintaining energy-efficiency without any extra information exchange among the sensor nodes in the network.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"62.5"}]}
