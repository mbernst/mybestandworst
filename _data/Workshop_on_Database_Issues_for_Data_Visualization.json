Based on this experience, we have designed Tioga-2 as a direct manipulation system that is more powerful and much easier to program. We present a detailed design of the revised system together with an extensive example of its application. We also give a progress report on a Tioga-2 implementation.","cites":"10","conferencePercentile":"100"}]}
