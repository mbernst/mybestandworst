We call this system 3D SKETCH. To reconstruct 3D objects from sketches, we limit the domain of renderable sketches and prepare a template for interpreting sketches. As long as a sketch can be matched to such a template, the system can reconstruct a mesh model from the sketch. The system collects information about strokes made, and uses that information for our rendering scheme. 1. INTRODUCTION Although the use of CAD systems has become commonplace, traditional sketching is often more efficient in the early stages of concept design. One reason is that CAD systems are too tedious to allow the quick expression of design ideas, thus interfering with the designer's creative process. Then, too, some designers do not like CAD images, which have have a very different style from rough sketches. We propose a new modeling and rendering system that enables users to construct a 3D model with an interface equivalent equivalent to sketching, and that displays the constructed model in sketch-like style that preserves the features of the user's strokes. We call this system 3D SKETCH. 3D SKETCH is intended to support the early stages of the product design process, when design sketches are often drawn 1","cites":"30","conferencePercentile":"100"}]}
