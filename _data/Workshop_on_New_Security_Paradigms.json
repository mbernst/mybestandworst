McDermott","author_ids":"1806681","abstract":"1. ABSTRACT The problem of integrity attacks via Trojan horse applications is so difficult that some computer security researchers and practitioners may object to it as an unreasonable research topic. We agree that the problem is difficult, but we argue that it is reasonable to consider it. We argue that the problem of application-based Trojan horses per se has not been solved; that previous integrity approaches do not offer significant protection in today's architectures and third, solutions that offer significant protection are available. Some of these solutions have been researched, but others have not. We invite other researchers to investigate the problem.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"7.692307692"}]}
