Providing large-scale Information Retrieval (IR), e.g. for searching the Word Wide Web, is an appealing application for P2P systems. The research community has presented several proposal for P2P-IR. However, so far the concepts of P2P and of IR have been intermin-gled. In this paper, we propose an architecture to structure P2P-IR systems. We differentiate between concepts belonging to the construction and maintenance of a P2P overlay network, and those belonging to IR. Furthermore, we distinguish basic P2P-IR concepts, which are likely to be needed in all P2P-IR systems, and advanced P2P-IR concepts, that rather depend on the flavor of the system. This decomposition of the P2P retrieval process is an important step towards a structured implementation of such systems. Furthermore , it allows a systematic sharing of methods and resources needed to perform retrieval. The next generation of global information retrieval systems will combine these distributed resources in new ways to provide more efficient web search.","cites":"21","conferencePercentile":"100"}]}
