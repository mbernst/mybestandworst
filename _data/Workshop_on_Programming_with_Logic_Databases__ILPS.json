Sheth, Christopher Wood, Vipul Kashyap","author_ids":"1709950, 5009404, 1716602","abstract":"This chapter discusses an extended deductive database prototype system, Q-Data, developed by Bellcore to improve data quality through data validation and cleanup. The key technology component of Q-Data is the extended deductive database system LDL++, developed at MCC. We discuss the issues of data quality improvement, the relevance of the deductive database technology such as the LDL++ system to data quality i m p r o vement tasks, and the system architecture of the prototype. Furthermore , we describe our experiences using the deductive database technology in an ongoing Q-Data trial attacking a real-world problem with test data from operational systems. Experiences related to engineering aspects of both the deductive database system and other component t e c hnologies, as well as pragmatic aspects of the implementation of Q-Data as a distributed system, are discussed.","cites":"7","conferencePercentile":"50"}]}
