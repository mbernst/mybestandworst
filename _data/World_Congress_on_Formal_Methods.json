The process calculus is a form of-calculus, with probabilistic scheduling instead of nondeterminism, over a term language that captures probabilistic polynomial time. The operational semantics of this calculus gives priority to communication over private channels, so that the presence of private communication does not aaect the observable probability of visible actions. Our deenition of observational equivalence involves asymptotic comparison of uniform process families, only requiring equivalence to within vanishing error probabilities. This deenition diiers from previous notions of probabilistic process equivalence that require equal probabilities for corresponding actions; asymptotics t our intended application and make equivalence transitive, thereby justifying the use of the term \\equivalence.\" Our security proof uses a series of lem-mas about probabilistic observational equivalence that may well prove useful for establishing correctness of other cryptographic protocols.","cites":"69","conferencePercentile":"96.07843137"}]}
