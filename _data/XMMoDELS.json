Agile methods are fast, adaptive, responsive; MDE is heavyweight, plan-first, and requires high up-front investment. But are agile methods and MDE really so contradictory? Or could they co-exist and even work together to maximize each other's benefits? In this talk, I will reflect upon our recent study with two large companies that have both recently introduced agile methods into a model-driven environment. I will describe where they succeeded, and failed. And discuss how MDE tools do or do not support working in an agile manner. This is joint work with Hakan Burden and Rogardt Heldal.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"14.28571429"}]}
