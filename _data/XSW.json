While the project also includes novel techniques for semantic enrichment, query management, and presentation techniques in multilingual information acquisition from the web, this paper addresses the question how to further exploit the acquired information; firstly, by linking it into more established decision support environments based on OLAP technologies; secondly, by using it as a basis to engage in negotiations concerning inter-organisational cooperation across European countries. Specific application domains studied within the project include financial reporting and controlling systems for the intra-organisational aspects, and fashion design applications as a typical example of inter-organisational cooperation.","cites":"9","conferencePercentile":"71.42857143"}]}
