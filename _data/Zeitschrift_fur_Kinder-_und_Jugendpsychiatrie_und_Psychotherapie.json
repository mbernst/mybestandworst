Data was obtained from an online questionnaire including CRAFFT-d and AUDIT.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 12250 participants, 54.2 % were found to have an alcohol use disorder due to the AUDIT. CRAFFT-d identifies 63.6 % with problematic alcohol consumption. The Phi-coefficient showed high agreement between AUDIT and CRAFFT-d classifications (Phi Phi = .57; chi(2) 3978.671**; df = 1, p > .001). At a score of 2 or higher, CRAFFT showed sensitivity of 88.8 % and specificity of 66.2 %.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe CRAFFT-d is a valid instrument for screening adolescents for problematic alcohol consumption. However, further comparison of CRAFFT items with diagnostic criteria for adolescents is needed.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"83.78378378"}]}
