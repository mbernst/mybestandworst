Opioid agonist and antagonist was also used in addition to methionine-enkephalin itself. Injection of the opioid, methionine-enkephalin and FK 33-824 significantly elevated hemolymph glucose level. In contrast, injection of naloxone in to crab resulted in decrease in hemolymph glucose level. Injection of naloxone prior to injection of methionine-enkephalin blocked the hyperglycemic action of methionine-enkephalin. Injection of methionine-enkephalin, FK 33824 and naloxone produced no significant effect on hemolymph glucose level in eyestalk-less crab. The alterations in the intact crab hemolymph glucose level hypothesised to be due to stimulation of release of hyperglycemic hormone during methionine-enkephalin and FK 33824 treatment and blocking of release of hyperglycemic hormone during naloxone treatment from the eyestalks of crab Oziotelphusa senex senex.","cites":"1","conferencePercentile":"62.5"}]}
