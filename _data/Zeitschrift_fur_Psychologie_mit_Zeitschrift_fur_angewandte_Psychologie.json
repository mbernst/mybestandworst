The duration and judged strength of after-effects are determined with respect to different fixation conditions (monocular and binocular fixation conditions as well as centric and eccentric fixation). The results show, that motion after-effects in spirals and waterfall displays are generated and processed in different ways within the visual system. The results are discussed on the basis of a metric of the visual system by means of the motion after-effect.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"50"}]}
