This phenomenon is called lateral masking. Proceeding on the assumption of Bouma (1970) lateral masking can be described in terms of retinal eccentricity of the target letter and the distance between target and flanking stimuli. In this paper, we will address to the question if these kinds of parameters are adequate for describing lateral masking effects. For this purpose, characteristics of the string like its length and its homogenity are varied. The subject's task is to identify the central letter of a tachistoscopically presented string. The targets in the string are flanked both by only x and by different randomly selected letters. Additionally, we varied the length of the string. The data show that these variations influence the strength of the masking effect. It is concluded that a pure sensorical approach is not sufficient for an explanation of lateral masking effects.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"45.83333333"}]}
