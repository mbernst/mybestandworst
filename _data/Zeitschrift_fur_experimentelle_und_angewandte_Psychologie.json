However, this hypothesis was never investigated experimentally in a well-controlled study. Twenty healthy subjects learned to increase and decrease their heart rate dependent upon two discriminative stimuli. In order to increase and decrease their heart rate they received exteroceptive feedback (movements of a rocket-ship on a video screen). Each trial lasted 6 s. The distance of the rocket-ship from a certain point indicated the amount of the achieved increase or decrease. Field dependent subjects scoring higher in field dependency as measured by the Embedded Figures Test were poorer at heart rate control on feedback and transfer trials (test trials with feedback removed) than were subjects scoring low in field dependency. This result may be of therapeutic interest in the application of behavioral medicine to psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"35.41666667"}]}
