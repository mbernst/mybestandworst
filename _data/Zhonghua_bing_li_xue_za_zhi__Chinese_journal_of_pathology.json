The expression of alpha-7 nAChR on astrocytes and neurons was detected by immunohistochemistry (ABC method). The alpha-7 nAChR protein level was measured by Western blotting. On the other hand, cultured astrocytes and neurons were treated with different concentrations of A-beta 25 - 35. The alpha-7 nAChR protein level was then measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIncreased number of astrocytes surrounding senile plaques was observed in AD brain tissues. In AD brain tissues, as compared to age-matched controls, alpha-7 nAChR protein level was increased in astrocytes, but decreased in neurons. High level of alpha-7 nAChR protein was also observed in mouse brain tissues with APP mutation. Exposure to A-beta 25 - 35 induced an increase (up to 38%) in alpha-7 nAChR protein level in astrocytes but a decrease (up to 32%) in neurons.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDecrease in alpha-7 nAChR level in neurons may be related to the pathogenesis of AD, whereas an increased level of alpha-7 nAChR in astrocytes, as induced by excessive A-beta, may represent a compensatory neuroprotective response.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"100"},{"venue":"Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology","id":"14b3f54a0dfc9a8f0673e0c32372376cd56e0077","venue_1":"Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology","year":"2010","title":"[Influence of APP(SWE) transfection on nicotinic receptors in cultured neuronal cells].","authors":"Yu An, Zhi Tang, Xiao-lan Qi, Yan Xiao, Ke-ren Shan, Zhi-zhong Guan","author_ids":"3560671, 7172221, 7864864, 4166958, 7479408, 8042815","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the influence of APP(SWE) on the expression of neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and its relationship with Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nAPP(SWE), carried the Swedish family AD double mutants, were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells and primary cultured neurons from rat brains to build a cellular model of AD. The mRNA levels of APP and nAChRs, and the protein levels of total APP, αAPPs and nAChRs in the cultured cells were measured using real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The numbers of α3 nAChR were determined by receptor-[³H]epibatidine binding assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIncreased expressions of Swedish 670/671 APP at mRNA and protein levels, and down-regulation of αAPPs were observed in both of the cultured neuronal cells transfected with APP(SWE). A significant increase of α7 nAChR expression at protein and mRNA levels was detected in the APP(SWE) transfected SH-SY5Y cells. On the other hand, after transfection with APP(SWE), the expressions of α3 nAChR at protein and mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y cells, and α4 nAChR at mRNA level in primary cultured neurons were inhibited. In addition, the numbers of receptor binding sites were deceased in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing with APP(SWE).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOverexpression of APP(SWE) can decrease αAPPs and modify nAChRs by increasing expression of α7 nAChR and decreasing α3 and α4 nAChRs, which might play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"100"}]}
