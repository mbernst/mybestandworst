The digital sound file was recorded by a male speaker and a female speaker (both of them are radio broadcaster).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe tonal identification material database, which included 288 items (72 loudness-balanced syllables in all 4 Mandarin tones) was established by digital filler and balanced for equal loudness. The complete material was recorded in two CDs in a male version and a female version. The speaker-specific masking noises were generated by filtering Gaussian white noise to the speaker's long-term average speech spectrum (LTASS) and by scaling the masking noises to the same RMS amplitudes, as those of the speech, in order to acquire the effective sound masking. The speaker-specific masking noises could be able or disable during the word presentation.

The V/A slope was steeper in boys than in young men, which was statistically significant (P<0.05). â‘£ In girls and young women, peak latency and magnitude of speech-ABR showed similar characteristics. No significant differences were found in either transient response or sustained response. The V/A slope between girls and young women was similar without significant difference (P>0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe female adults have shorter wave latency and larger amplitude of speech-ABR than males, which suggests that females have better speech encoding in brainstem. There are few differences between female and girls in wave latency and amplitude. The speech encoding in brainstem in young men tends to become worse than in boys. It implies that the increase of androgen might weaken the ability of the speech encoding in brainstem.","cites":"0","conferencePercentile":"53.84615385"},{"venue":"Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery","id":"e971dababd736648890adc199f41b60e3b3c29d6","venue_1":"Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery","year":"2007","title":"[Ultrastructural changes of olfactory epithelium of the patients with olfactory disorder caused by common cold].","authors":"Gang Liu, Hai Zhang","author_ids":"1697913, 1703065","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nThe study focus on the olfactory changes post upper respiratory infection, through observation of nasal mucosa and it's ultrastructural changes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOlfactory test was performed by odor threshold and identification test (T&T olfactometry).

(2) Olfactory vesicles reduced obviously, even if the olfactory vesicles existed, the olfactory cilia showed reduction. Some olfactory vesicles still existed, but the number of olfactory cilia reduced. Some olfactory vesicles changed their shape due to vacuolization.

Participants were divided into four groups according to the age for surgery: A (1-2 years), B (2-3 years), C (3-4 years) and D (4-5 years). The auditory skill and speech perception ability of CI children were evaluated by trained audiologists using the infant-toddler/meaningful auditory integration scale (IT-MAIS/MAIS) questionnaire, the Mandarin Early Speech Perception (MESP) test and the Mandarin Pediatric Speech Intelligibility (MPSI) test. The questionnaires were used in face to face interviews with the parents or guardians. Each child was assessed before the operation and 3 months, 6 months, 12 months after switch-on.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter cochlear implantation, early postoperative auditory development and speech perception gradually improved. All MAIS/IT-MAIS scores showed a similar increasing trend with the rehabilitation duration (F=5.743, P=0.007). Preoperative and post operative MAIS/IT-MAIS scores of children in age group C (3-4 years) was higher than that of other groups. Children who had longer hearing aid experience before operation demonstrated higher MAIS/IT-MAIS scores than those with little or no hearing aid experience (F=4.947, P=0.000).
