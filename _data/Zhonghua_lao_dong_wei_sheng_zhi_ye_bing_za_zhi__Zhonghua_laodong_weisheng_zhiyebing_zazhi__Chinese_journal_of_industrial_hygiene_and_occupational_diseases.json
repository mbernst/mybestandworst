Once the height of lifting was over shoulder, the MAWL was decreased dramatically. The RWL was greater than the MAWL at 25 cm horizontal distance in male subjects, but the RWL was smaller than the MAWL at the distance of 45 cm and 63 cm. The average MAWL of male subjects was 30.8% greater than that of female subjects. The MAWL was decreased gradually with increase of the horizontal distance at the same height of lifting. The result of the male subjects was consistent with that of the female subjects. For the asymmetric lifting tasks of the male subjects, the bigger the angle of rotation was, the less the MAWL became. The angle of rotation had negative correlation with the capability of lifting (r = -0.996 6, P < 0.01). When the subjects performed asymmetric lifting tasks, the RWL was smaller than the MAWL and the difference was significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe revision is sufficient for the horizontal distance and asymmetric lifting in the NIOSH lifting equation, but it is not suitable for height, especially for the task of lifting over shoulder. The RWL for the task of lifting over shoulder should be lowered. The factor of gender should be taken into account in the lifting equation and the constant of gender S can be added. Then S = 1 for male while S = 0.692 for female.","cites":"5","conferencePercentile":"100"},{"venue":"Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases","id":"d8004d0c07654a0480aa8ca7c063e85aba338313","venue_1":"Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases","year":"2012","title":"[Effect of JNK signal transduction pathway in intense noise-induced apoptosis of vestibular hair cells in guinea pigs].","authors":"Ming Wei, Wei-tao Wang, Tao Zhang, Ling Tu, Ying-hong Liang, Jia Liu, Jun-hua Zhang, Yan-jie Gong","author_ids":"3424372, 7634841, 1743147, 8509381, 7668878, 7136836, 8215329, 7419895","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the mechanism of intense noise-induced apoptosis of vestibular hair cells in guinea pigs and the effect of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway in intense noise-induced apoptosis of vestibular hair cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-two guinea pigs were randomly and equally divided into 1, 5, and 15 d experimental groups and control group. The guinea pigs in the experimental groups were exposed to 4 kHz narrow-band noise at 120 dB SPL for 4 h and then subjected to measurement of auditory brainstem response at 1, 5, or 15 d after noise exposure.

The dose- and time-response relationships of methomyl with AChE activity in human erythrocyte membrane, rat erythrocyte membrane, cortical synapses, cerebellar synapses, hippocampal synapses, and striatal synapses were evaluated. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and bimolecular rate constant (K) of methomyl for AChE activity in different regions were calculated, and the type of inhibition of AChE activity by methomyl was determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAChE achieved the maximum activity at 370 Â°C, and the optimal time to determine initial reaction velocity was 0-17 min. There were dose- and time-response relationships between methomyl and AChE activity in the erythrocyte membrane and various brain areas. The IC50 value of methomyl for AChE activity in human erythrocyte membrane was higher than that in rat erythrocyte membrane, while the Ki value of methomyl for AChE activity in rat erythrocyte membrane was higher than that in human erythrocyte membrane. Among synapses in various brain areas, the striatum had the highest IC50 value, followed by the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, while the cerebral cortex had the highest Ki value, followed by the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum.
