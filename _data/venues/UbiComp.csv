Miller, Elizabeth D. Mynatt, Lena Mamykina","7454378, 2300200, 1959580, 1752751, 3245570","Personal health-tracking technologies have become a part of mainstream culture. Their growing popularity and widespread adoption present an opportunity for the design of new interventions to improve wellness and health. However, there is an increasing concern that these technologies are failing to inspire long-term adoption. In order to understand why users abandon personal health-tracking technologies, we analyzed advertisements of secondary sales of such technologies on Craigslist. We conducted iterative inductive and deductive analyses of approximately 1600 advertisements of personal health-tracking technologies posted over the course of one month across the US. We identify health motivations and rationales for abandonment and present a set of design implications. We call for improved theories that help translate between existing theories designed to explain psychological effects of health behavior change and the technologies that help people make those changes.",15,93.6974789916

Our study design and analysis were guided by ideas from postcolonial computing; we use our qualitative findings, and outcomes from a drawing exercise, to show existing flaws in mobile phone design, and to explore how repairers' knowledge can lead to handsets that are better suited for rural Kenyans. Our argument is that, by engaging with repairers ""[on] their own terms,"" technologists can expand conversations around designing for the 'developing' world that go beyond building novel smartphone applications. In fact, such conversations can also include reimagining mobile phones, and supporting local repairers' efforts to manufacture them. We conclude by discussing ways to improve upon postcolonial approaches to technology design.",3,49.1596638655

Many media fa&#231;ades cover most of the outer shell of a building and come with a 3D form factor. They offer great potential for remote interaction in which the interactive area goes beyond the parts of the fa&#231;ade that are visible from the user's current perspective. Common interaction techniques often focus on a fixed part of the media fa&#231;ade. This restricts exploiting the full capabilities and the potential of such gigantic screens. In this paper we describe how to apply cartographic map projections to create 2D map representations of media fa&#231;ades to address this problem.

In our within-subjects double-crossover study, participants collaborated on 4 planning tasks. Based on video, logs, questionnaires and interviews, we conclude that both classes of interface have a place.

Qualitative fieldwork reveals that nonprofit organizations in the food assistance ecology engage in location-based information practices that could be enhanced by the design of a LBIS. Two practices that would benefit from a collaborative LBIS are 1) practices of matching in which nonprofit workers help individuals who are seeking assistance to food resources and 2) practices of distribution in which nonprofit workers help organizations access and deliver food resources to clients. In order to support such practices across organizations the cooperative design component of this research suggests that an LIBS should: support the role of intermediaries who engage in practices of matching and distribution; provide interactive mapping tools that match resources to need; enable organizations to control visibility over specific data; and document work and impact. This research further suggests that designers should explore the wide variety of spatial patterns that must align and overlap such that ecologies of nonprofit organizations might synergistically work together to address pressing social needs.",4,63.2653061224

Using an app publicly available for Android phones, we logged anonymous data from 31311 calls of 418 different users. The data shows that information easily available in mobile phones, such as the time since the last call, the time since the last ringer mode change, or the device posture, can predict call availability with an accuracy of 83.2% (Kappa = .646). Personalized models can increase the accuracy to 87% on average. Features related to when the user was last active turned out to be strong predictors. This shows that simple contextual cues approximating user activity are worthwhile investigating when designing context-aware ubiquitous communication systems.",6,60.5263157895

Tasks such as the prediction of human movement can be addressed through the usage of these data, in turn offering support for more advanced applications, such as adaptive mobile services with proactive context-based functions. This paper presents an hybrid method for predicting human mobility on the basis of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The proposed approach clusters location histories according to their characteristics, and latter trains an HMM for each cluster. The usage of HMMs allows us to account with location characteristics as unobservable parameters, and also to account with the effects of each individual's previous actions.

Although classified as a mild disability, color blindness has important effects on the daily activity of people, preventing them from performing their tasks in the most natural and effective ways. In order to address this issue we developed Chroma, a wearable augmented-reality system based on Google Glass that allows users to see a filtered image of the current scene in real-time. Chroma automatically adapts the scene-view based on the type of color blindness, and features dedicated algorithms for color saliency. Based on interviews with 23 people with color blindness we implemented four modes to help colorblind individuals distinguish colors they usually can't see. Although Glass still has important limitations, initial tests of Chroma in the lab show that colorblind individuals using Chroma can improve their color recognition in a variety of real-world activities. The deployment of Chroma on a wearable augmented-reality device makes it an effective digital aid with the potential to augment everyday activities, effectively providing access to different color dimensions for colorblind people.",11,79.4736842105

The perception and reactions of future users to these three privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) are compared in the present article and an attempt is made to understand the reasoning behind their preferences.

Since smartphones are ubiquitously used as communication media these days, <i>interruptibility prediction</i> on smartphones has started to attract great interest from both academia and industry. Previous studies, in general, attempted to model interruptibility using the behaviors at the current moment and in the immediate past (e.g., 5 minutes before). However, a person's interruptibility at a certain moment is indeed affected by his/her preceding behaviors for several reasons. Motivated by this long-term effect, in this paper we propose a novel methodology of extracting features based on past behaviors from smartphone sensor data. The primary difference from previous studies is that we systematically consider a <i>longer history of up to a day</i> in addition to the current point and the immediate past. To represent behaviors in a day accurately and compactly, our methodology divides a day into multiple timeslots and then, for each timeslot, derives relevant features such as the temporal shapes of the time series of the sensor data. In order to verify the advantage of our methodology, we collected a data set of smartphone usage from 25 participants for four weeks and obtained a license to a large-scale public data set constructed from 907 users over approximately nine months. The experimental results on the two data sets show that <i>looking back to the beginning of the current day</i> improves prediction accuracy by up to 16% and 7%, respectively, compared with the baseline and state-of-the-art methods.",0,39.5652173913

In addition, the fact that bike usage pattern is affected not only by common contextual factors (e.g., time and weather) but also by opportunistic contextual factors (e.g., social and traffic events) poses a great challenge.

To improve user experience, LBSs often provide personalized recommendations to users by mining their activity (i.e., check-in) data from location-based social networks. However, releasing user check-in data makes users vulnerable to inference attacks, as private data (e.g., gender) can often be inferred from the users' check-in data. In this paper, we propose PrivCheck, a customizable and continuous privacy-preserving check-in data publishing framework providing users with continuous privacy protection against inference attacks. The key idea of PrivCheck is to obfuscate user check-in data such that the privacy leakage of user-specified private data is minimized under a given data distortion budget, which ensures the utility of the obfuscated data to empower personalized LBSs. Since users often give LBS providers access to both their historical check-in data and future check-in streams, we develop two data obfuscation methods for historical and online check-in publishing, respectively.

Unlike traditional cameras that are used deliberately and sporadically, lifelogging devices are always 'on' and automatically capturing images. Such features may challenge users' (and bystanders') expectations about privacy and control of image gathering and dissemination. While lifelogging cameras are growing in popularity, little is known about privacy perceptions of these devices or what kinds of privacy challenges they are likely to create.
 To explore how people manage privacy in the context of lifelogging cameras, as well as which kinds of first-person images people consider 'sensitive,' we conducted an <i>in situ</i> user study (<i>N</i> = 36) in which participants wore a lifelogging device for a week, answered questionnaires about the collected images, and participated in an exit interview. Our findings indicate that: 1) some people may prefer to manage privacy through <i>in situ</i> physical control of image collection in order to avoid later burdensome review of all collected images; 2) a combination of factors including time, location, and the objects and people appearing in the photo determines its 'sensitivity;' and 3) people are concerned about the privacy of bystanders, despite reporting almost no opposition or concerns expressed by bystanders over the course of the study.",22,95.7894736842

However, these techniques can only offer limited degrees of distinctions among different objects and cannot provide more inherent information about these objects. In this paper, we leverage RFID technology to further label different objects with RFID tags. We deploy additional RFID antennas to the COTS depth camera and propose a continuous scanning-based scheme to scan the objects, i.e., the system continuously rotates and samples the depth of field and RF-signals from these tagged objects. In this way, by pairing the tags with the objects according to the correlations between the depth of field and RF-signals, we can accurately identify and distinguish multiple tagged objects to realize the vision of ""tell me what I see"" from the augmented reality system.

We also show that most algorithms fail to correctly predict transitions, i.e. situations in which users move between different places. To this end, we analyze the performance of 18 prediction algorithms focusing on their ability to predict transitions. We run our analysis on a data set of mobility traces of 37 users collected over a period of 1.5 years.

Traditional navigation systems sample the phone's GPS at a fixed rate (usually around 1Hz), regardless of factors such as current vehicle speed and distance from the next navigation waypoint. This practice results in a large energy consumption and unnecessarily reduces the attainable length of a navigation session, if the phone is left unplugged. The paper investigates two questions. First, would drivers be willing to sacrifice some of the affordances of modern navigation systems in order to prolong battery life? Second, how much energy could be saved using straightforward alternative localization mechanisms, applied to complement GPS for vehicular navigation? According to a survey we conducted of 500 drivers, as much as 91% of drivers said they would like to have a vehicular navigation application with an energy saving mode. To meet this need, eNav exploits on-board accelerometers for approximate location sensing when the vehicle is sufficiently far from the next navigation waypoint (or is stopped). A user test-study of eNav shows that it results in roughly the same user experience as standard GPS navigation systems, while reducing navigation energy consumption by almost 80%. We conclude that drivers find an energy-saving mode on phone-based vehicular navigation applications desirable, even at the expense of some loss of functionality, and that significant savings can be achieved using straightforward location sensing mechanisms that avoid frequent GPS sampling.",8,86.5546218487

However, GPS positioning quickly drains a phone's battery and cannot be used indoors. On the other hand, WiFi positioning provides energy-efficient indoor and outdoor positioning with reasonable accuracy. However, WiFi positioning sometimes makes large errors caused by various reasons, e.g., the movement of reference WiFi access points. In this paper we attempt to detect and correct such errors automatically by performing outlier detection in time series.
 So, we solve this problem by comparing a user's current measurement at time T with her coordinate point at time T predicted from her past coordinate history, and judging whether the current measurement is correct or not by computing the distance between the measurement location and the predicted location. However, it is difficult to predict the user's coordinates accurately with a single prediction method (predictor) because the user's context (e.g., migration speed and sparseness of past coordinates) greatly affects predictor performance. We thus design a context-aware error detection method by employing an ensemble of predictors that have different strengths and weaknesses.",3,55.8309037901

Moreover, the swipes do not encode any notion of how far the event is located from the user, neither is the GPS location of the user accurate.

Yet, the question of what tools Ubicomp researchers can create for residential resource management remains open. To begin to address this omission, we present a qualitative study of 15 households and their current management practices around the water, electricity and natural gas systems in the home. We find that in-the-moment resource consumption is mostly invisible to householders and that they desire more real-time information to help them save money, keep their homes comfortable and be environmentally friendly. Designing for domestic sustainability therefore turns on improving the visibility of resource production and consumption costs as well as supporting both individuals and collectives in behavior change. Domestic sustainability also highlights the caveat of potentially creating a green divide by making resource management available only to those who can afford the technologies to support being green. Finally, we suggest that the Ubicomp community can contribute to the domestic and broader sustainability agenda by incorporating green values in designs and highlight the challenge of collecting data on being green.",121,88.0952380952

While many endeavors have been devoted to improving battery lifetime, they have fallen short in understanding how users interact with batteries. In response, we have conducted a systematic user study on battery use and recharge behavior, an important aspect of user-battery interaction, on both laptop computers and mobile phones. Based on this study, we present three important findings: 1) most recharges happen when the battery has substantial energy left, 2) a considerable portion of the recharges are driven by context (location and time), and those driven by battery levels usually occur when the battery level is high, and 3) there is great variation among users and systems. These findings indicate that there is substantial opportunity to enhance existing energy management policies, which solely focus on extending battery lifetime and often lead to excess battery energy upon recharge, by adapting the aggressiveness of the policy to match the usage and recharge patterns of the device. We have designed, deployed, and evaluated a user-and statistics-driven energy management system, Llama, to exploit the battery energy in a user-adaptive and user-friendly fashion to better serve the user. We also conducted a user study after the deployment that shows Llama effectively harvests excess battery energy for a better user experience (brighter display) or higher quality of service (more application data) without a noticeable change in battery lifetime.",64,75.0

WISDOM takes advantage of historical cellular fingerprints (i.e., the pairs of Cell-ID and Received Signal Strength Indicator) to directly model the WLAN coverage, and perform WLAN availability prediction based on the models given a query cellular fingerprint. Similarity and Classification methods are introduced to work in the framework as prediction methods.

By nature, however, mobile phone data offer very low spatial and temporal resolutions. It remains largely unknown how the predictability changes with respect to different spatial/temporal scales. Using high-resolution GPS data, this paper investigates the scaling effects on predictability. Given specified spatial-temporal scales, recorded trajectories are encoded into long strings of distinct locations, and several information-theoretic measures of predictability are derived. Somewhat surprisingly, high predictability is still present at very high spatial/temporal resolutions. Moreover, the predictability is independent of the overall mobility area covered. This suggests highly regular mobility behaviors. Moreover, by varying the scales over a wide range, an invariance is observed which suggests that certain trade-offs between the predicting accuracy and spatial-temporal resolution are unavoidable. As many applications in ubiquitous computing concern mobility, these findings should have direct implications.",20,88.7096774194

This map is usually built manually by a person holding the mapping device, which results in orientation-dependent fingerprints due to signal attenuation by the human body. To offset this distortion, fingerprints are typically collected for multiple orientations, but this requires a high effort for large localization areas. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the mapping effort by modeling the WLAN signal attenuation caused by the human body. By applying the model to the captured signal to compensate for the attenuation, it is possible to generate an orientation-independent fingerprint. We demonstrate that our model is location and person independent and its output is comparable with manually created radio maps. By using the model, the WLAN scanning effort can be reduced by 75% to 87.5% (depending on the number of orientations).",0,13.2653061224

We study a single organization that moved between two different buildings, affording a unique opportunity to examine how space alone can affect interactions. The analysis is based on two large scale deployments of wireless sensing technologies: short-range, lightweight RFID tags capable of detecting face-to-face interactions.

This vision has since expanded to include a more diverse range of devices, services and networks to become an Internet of anything, anywhere, connected, anyhow. Security and privacy management for the IoT remains a core challenge.
 Many IoT devices maybe may have zero or minimal security by design because they are low resource, low power devices, designed to work as closed vertical services. Security threats and risks may be higher because devices are unattended, use local wireless communication that have no or weak encryption making them more susceptible to eavesdropping and because users find security too unusable to setup and operate and hence leave devices relatively unsecure. It may also be less problematic to reproduce and fake data sources, access nodes and data sinks that interact with IoT devices in order to attack devices or the services they access. Devices can be moved between or removed from private, communal, public and hostile physical spaces. There is a higher risk of a loss of privacy for human users and organisations because of an increased ability to eavesdrop, because of wireless networks with soft boundaries, and because embedded environment devices can sense smaller amounts of physical trails with a greater degree of sensitivity and accuracy. A specific focus is on the need for IoT security to adapt. The adaptation has multiple dimensions. We can adapt existing conventional security models to more effectively secure an IoT. We can adapt security pre-planned and unplanned context changes such as different moving around in different physical spaces. IoT systems can be designed to self-adapt. IoT systems need to adapt to the active (re) configuration and maintenance of IoT devices and systems of devices by users and by artificial agents.

When used in social contexts several problems regarding how mobile devices convey notifications arise. Auditory notification cues, such as those generally used by mobile phones, can be intrusive and attention demanding. Tactile cues, such as vibrations, are very private and subtle. However, since it is hard for other people nearby to perceive such cues, it can be awkward to understand the actions which a notification cue can give rise to, i.e., tactile cues are not public. We discuss the design space of notification cues for mobile devices and propose an exploration of the space which combines the two dimensions of subtlety and publicity. We conclude with a description of current and future work. 1 INTRODUCTION Mobile information technology such as mobile phones and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) can provide users with services that make it easier for them to keep themselves available to and contact others, to organize their time and to become notified of important events. There is a great interest in such devices among both professionals and consumers. One consequence of the proliferation of mobile information technology is that its use influences almost all social situations including situations outside the typical work setting, since the device is on at all times and follows its user rather than being bound to a specific location (e.g. work or home). One of the prime functionalities of mobile devices is to notify their users of certain events. For instance, mobile phones notifies users of incoming calls, and PDAs convey notifications regarding events scheduled in the users' digital calendars. Notification cues emanating from these devices are in many situations perceived as inappropriate, both by the owner of a device and to the people nearby. Problems regarding how notifications are conveyed from mobile devices, in particular in social settings, need to be addressed. In this paper, we explore complementary ways of conveying notifications from mobile devices. The ambition has been to explore various notification cues which might be more socially acceptable. First we discuss some of the problems with notifications , and then sketch the design space of notification cues for mobile devices. We conclude with a description of current and future work.",26,31.8181818182

With daunting Or-wellian visions looming, it is easy to conclude that tamper-proof technical protection mechanisms such as strong anonymization and encryption are the only solutions to such privacy threats. However, we argue that such perfect protection for personal information will hardly be achievable, and propose instead to build systems that help others respect our personal privacy, enable us to be aware of our own privacy, and to rely on social and legal norms to protect us from the few wrongdoers. We introduce a privacy awareness system targeted at ubiquitous computing environments that allows data collectors to both announce and implement data usage policies, as well as providing data subjects with technical means to keep track of their personal information as it is stored, used, and possibly removed from the system. Even though such a system cannot guarantee our privacy, we believe that it can create a sense of accountability in a world of invisible services that we will be comfortable living in and interacting with. 1 Motivation It is undisputed that a future world full of smart and cooperating artifacts will pose great risks to our personal privacy: In an environment containing countless, invisible sensors that constantly monitor their surroundings and communicate their findings to each of their peers, both real-world and virtual transactions are certain to find their way into sheer limitless data storage systems, to be saved forever and recalled at a moment's notice. Much under discussion, however, is how to deal with this frightening vision. Should we give up on privacy as we know it today, and – at least potentially – make everybody see everything anytime [2]? Or should we instead try even harder to find the technological means that guarantee that our information stays private by employing state-of-the-art encryption and anonymization technology? Even though clever anonymization technology [10] can make tracing our digital identity almost impossible, and encryption schemes exist that seem to be sufficiently hard to break in the foreseeable future, personal privacy entails more than just secret communication and masked identity.

However, features needed at prediction time (such as mobile information that impacts battery life, or information collected from users <i>via</i> experience sampling) may be costly to collect. In addition, both cost and value of a feature may change dynamically based on real-world context (such as battery life or user location) and prediction context (what features are already known, and what their values are). We contribute a framework for <i>dynamically trading off feature cost against prediction quality at prediction time.</i> We demonstrate this work in the context of three prediction tasks: providing prospective tenants estimates for energy costs in potential homes, estimating momentary stress levels from both sensed and user-provided mobile data, and classifying images to facilitate opportunistic device interactions.

These errors adversely affect the performance and quality of user experience of the applications requiring device headings.

Headio achieves this by aggregating ceiling images of an indoor environment, and by using computer vision-based pattern detection techniques to provide directional references. To achieve zero-configured and energy-efficient heading sensing, Headio also utilizes multimodal sensing techniques to dynamically schedule sensing tasks. To fully evaluate the system, we implemented Headio on both Android and iOS mobile platforms, and performed comprehensive experiments in both small-scale controlled and large-scale public indoor environments.

In-situ measurement of human behavior has the potential to overcome the short comings of gold-standard surveys that have been used for decades by the medical community. However, current sensing systems have mainly focused on tracking physical health; some have approximated aspects of mental health based on proximity measurements but have not been compared against medically accepted screening instruments. In this paper, we show the feasibility of a multi-modal mobile sensing system to simultaneously assess mental and physical health. By continuously capturing fine-grained motion and privacy-sensitive audio data, we are able to derive different metrics that reflect the results of commonly used surveys for assessing well-being by the medical community. In addition, we present a case study that highlights how errors in assessment due to the subjective nature of the responses could potentially be avoided by continuous mobile sensing.",38,92.8

However, slower progress is being made in activity recognition which remains often unreliable in everyday environments. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage the increasing capacity to gather data at a population-scale towards improving existing models of human behavior. Specifically, we consider the various social phenomena and environmental factors that cause people to develop correlated behavioral patterns, especially within communities connected by strong social ties. Reasons underpinning correlated behavior include shared externalities (e.g., work schedules, weather, traffic conditions), that shape options and decisions; and cases of adopted behavior, as people learn from each other or assume group norms due to social pressure. Most existing approaches to modeling human behavior ignore all of these phenomena and recognize activities solely on the basis of sensor data captured from a single individual. We propose the <i>Networked Community Behavior</i> (NCB) framework for activity recognition, specifically designed to exploit community-scale behavioral patterns. Under NCB, patterns of community behavior are mined to identify social ties that can signal correlated behavior, this information is used to augment sensor-based inferences available from the actions of individuals. Our evaluation of NCB shows it is able to outperform existing approaches to behavior modeling across four mobile sensing datasets that collectively require a diverse set of activities to be recognized.",3,34.7368421053

Recent advancements of information and location-aware technologies have enhanced our capability of collecting individual trajectory data for people, vehicles, or other moving objects. A trajectory can reveal the individual's spatiotemporal activities. Large amounts of trajectories could reflect people's behavior patterns. Thus, trajectory data mining and analysis can be useful to ubiquitous computing. The objective of this workshop is to share knowledge of ongoing research among researchers and practitioners, to present and discuss work related to novel methods, innovative applications, and future trends in the field. Trajectory data mining has been a hot topic in the interdisciplinary field of computer science and geographic information science. Particularly, recent advancements of information and location-aware technologies have enhanced our capability of collecting individual trajectory data for people, vehicles, or other moving objects. An individual trajectory can reveal the individual's activities in space and over time. Large amounts of individual trajectories could reflect people's preferences and behavior patterns. Thus, trajectory data mining and analysis can be useful to ubiquitous computing. The objective of this workshop is to share knowledge of ongoing research among researchers and practitioners, to present and discuss work related to novel methods of trajectory data mining and analysis, innovative applications, and future trends in the field. Trajectory data mining and knowledge discovery have been actively pursued in computer science and database research. Trajectory data mining and analysis covers a wide range of topics. Regarding methodology development for the trajectory data mining for location-based services (LBS), there are several research focuses. The most popular topic is trajectory clustering, such as developing a new partition-and-group trajectory clustering algorithm TRACLUS to discover common sub-trajectories from a trajectory database (Lee et al., 2007), extending the concept of micro-cluster to moving micro-cluster (Li et al., 2004) and proposing a unified framework to address the problem of clustering moving object in spatial networks (Chen et al., 2007). Another research focus is frequent pattern mining, such as presenting a database projection based method to extract long, sharable frequent routes (Gidófalvi & Pedersen 2009), using a "" region-of-interest "" approach to extract T-patterns from trajectory data (Giannotti et al., 2007), proposing a methodology to allow the user to extract patterns from trajectories under considerations of both moving object data and geographic information (Bogorny et al., 2009) and proposing Flock pattern, leadership, convergence and encounter …",0,12.8

We used a participatory research approach in which participants, acting as collaborative ethnographers and co-designers, chose how to describe their homes to us and which existing technologies to discuss. A qualitative analysis of the conversations identified two main themes. The first finding is the highly gendered nature of roles in the Korean home, influenced by traditional Confucian values and reinforced by contemporary neo-liberal norms. The second finding is that domestic technologies are used, adopted, and imagined in the context of these gendered social dynamics rather than just according to functional needs. In conclusion, we emphasize the need to attend to the social dynamics of the home in the design of politically sensitive domestic technologies, which will enable the inclusion of marginalized voices, such as women, in design.",3,55.8309037901

State-of-the-art studies have shown that routine mobility patterns can be modeled stochastically, while rare human mobility modeling, essential to a variety of urban computing scenarios, such as emergency management and traffic regulation, is a much more challenging and understudied problem. Instead of training a rare-event-specific human mobility model, which suffers from the particularity of the rare events, in this paper we provide a new insight into rare events and propose a novel algorithm, CityCoupling, which establishes an intercity spatial mapping that uses human mobility in one city as input and reproduces human mobility in another city. More intuitively, we attempt to answer the question ""What if this rare event happened in another city?"". To find the optimal intercity spatial mapping, we utilize an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a probabilistic geographical correspondence matrix by regarding intercity trajectory matching as latent variables. Thereafter, a Gibbs sampling-based multiple hidden Markov model generates simulated trajectories. We apply our approach to a large mobile phone GPS dataset in Japan and determine the spatial mapping between Tokyo and Osaka to transfer the human mobility at the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake in Tokyo, which was heavily affected, to simulate what might have occurred if Osaka had been struck by the earthquake. We conduct the evaluation by assuming that New Year's Countdown is a rare event that occurs simultaneously in both Tokyo and Osaka, and thus we quantitatively compare our simulation with the ground truth in Osaka.",0,39.5652173913

RunBuddy is designed to be a convenient and unobtrusive exercise feedback system, and only utilizes commodity devices including smartphone and Bluetooth headset. A key challenge in designing RunBuddy is that the sound of breathing typically has very low intensity and is susceptible to interference. To reliably measure running rhythm, we propose a novel approach that integrates ambient sensing based on accelerometer and microphone, and a physiological model called Locomotor Respiratory Coupling (LRC), which indicates possible ratios between the stride and breathing frequencies. We evaluate RunBuddy through experiments involving 13 subjects and 39 runs.

We conducted two user studies with 19 developers to evaluate the usability of PADA. We show that developers benefit from using PADA in the implementation and power tuning of mobile sensing applications.",0,39.5652173913

Our results indicate that there are statistically significant associations between automatically tracked behavioral features related to sleep, mobility, conversations, smart-phone usage and self-reported indicators of mental health in schizophrenia. Using these features we build inference models capable of accurately predicting aggregated scores of mental health indicators in schizophrenia with a mean error of 7.6% of the score range.

While existing efforts have predominantly focused on understanding the explicit user intent expressed by a textual or voice query, this paper presents an approach to context-aware and personalized entity recommendation which understands the implicit intent without any explicit user input on the phone. The approach, highly motivated from a large-scale mobile click-through analysis, is able to rank both the entity types and the entities within each type (here an entity is a local business, e.g., ""I love sushi,"" while an entity type is a category, e.g., ""restaurant""). The recommended entity types and entities are relevant to both user context (past behaviors) and sensor context (time and geo-location). Specifically, it estimates the generation probability of an entity by a given user conditioned on the current context in a probabilistic framework. A random-walk propagation is then employed to refine the estimated probability by mining the temporal patterns among entities. We deploy a recommendation application based on the proposed approach on Window Phone 7 devices. We evaluate recommendation performance on 10 thousand mobile clicks, as well as user experience through subjective user studies. We show that the application is effective to facilitate the exploration and discovery of surroundings for mobile users.",20,83.6

However, the number of air quality monitoring stations is usually limited, and thus spatially fine-grained air quality estimation is a challenging task. This paper proposes a method for inferring spatially fine-grained air quality information throughout a city. On one hand, since air quality is affected by multiple factors (e.g., factory waste gases and automobile exhaust fumes), this method employs various data sources, including traffic, road network, point of interests (POIs), and check-ins from social network services, which are related to air quality, to conduct the estimation. On the other hand, since the labeled data are highly limited due to the sparseness of monitoring stations, this method uses an improved ensemble semi-supervised learning (Semi-EP) to establish the relationship between the various data sources and urban air quality. Semi-EP firstly generates multiple classifiers from the original labeled data set and these classifiers are retrained in the iterative co-training process. Then, ensemble pruning technique is used to select the most-diverse subset from these multiple classifiers. This method is evaluated on the real-world dataset of Hangzhou city, China, and the experimental results have demonstrated its advantages over state-of-the-art methods.",0,39.5652173913

Inspired by the excellent work of relevant scholars, we turn to explore the field of human-computer interaction using finger-grained gestures under WiFi environment. In this paper, we present Wi-Finger - the first solution using ubiquitous wireless signals to achieve number text input in WiFi devices. We implement a prototype of WiFinger on a commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure. Our scheme is based on the key intuition that while performing a certain gesture, the fingers of a user move in a unique formation and direction and thus generate a unique pattern in the time series of Channel State Information (CSI) values. WiFinger is deigned to recognize a set of finger-grained gestures, which are further used to realize continuous text input in off-the-shelf WiFi devices. As the results show, WiFinger achieves up to 90.4% average classification accuracy for recognizing 9 digits finger-grained gestures from American Sign Language (ASL), and its average accuracy for single individual number text input in desktop reaches 82.67% within 90 digits.",0,39.5652173913

Paradiso","2970336, 4798651","We have designed an active tagging system that responds to a coded optical beam from several meters away. The tags contain a minimalist microprocessor that ambiently operates in shutdown mode and, upon detecting particular frequency components in the AM-modulated interrogation beam, awakens to decode the incident digital message and produce an appropriate response. The lack of linear amplifiers means that these tags draw under 0.5 µA when sleeping, hence can operate up to 10 years on a lithium coin cell. Such devices are practical demonstrations of the potential of ubiquitous computing where common, nearly passive objects have a sense of identity and the ability to respond to external stimuli. In our example, the interrogator is a "" flashlight "" , with which one scans an area; when the light beam hits a tag programmed with a code that matches that sent by the interrogator, an on-tag LED flashes, indicating that the desired object is "" found "". A prime goal of ubiquitous computing [1] is the embedding of sensing, communication, and computation into everyday objects. One consequence of this paradigm is that perhaps nothing will be lost again, allowing us to gain rapid access to the objects we want. This is particularly important in the age of digital storage media, where information content is often not obviously expressed by the appearance of packaging. The mechanical constraints of CD's, DVD's, MiniDV's, etc. means that their content is abstracted into or scrawled onto anonymous, homogeneous containers. This is even true of books. How many times have we stared at a shelf full of books in the library only to find what we are looking for half an hour later? The motivation behind the tagging system described in this paper is to find a practical way to give everyday objects a sense of identity and the ability to decide how to respond to external stimuli. The ideal tags for this application should be completely passive and last forever. The tag should produce an apparent response for a positive or negative identification when interrogated with a coded message from several meters away.

As a result, there is not yet a highly accurate automated nutrition monitoring method that can be used with a variety of foods. We propose that multi-modal sensing (in-ear audio plus head and wrist motion) can be used to more accurately classify food type, as audio and motion features provide complementary information. Further, we propose that knowing food type is critical for estimating amount consumed in combination with sensor data. To test this we use data from people wearing audio and motion sensors, with ground truth annotated from video and continuous scale data. With data from 40 unique foods we achieve a classification accuracy of 82.7% with a combination of sensors (versus 67.8% for audio alone and 76.2% for head and wrist motion).

Currently, assessment of overuse or problematic use depends on one-time, self-reported behavioral information about phone use. Due to the known issues with self-reports in such types of assessments, we explore an automated, objective and repeatable approach for assessing problematic usage. We collect a wide range of phone usage data from smartphones, identify a number of usage features that are relevant to this assessment, and build detection models based on Adaboost with machine learning algorithms automatically detecting problematic use. We found that the number of apps used per day, the ratio of SMSs to calls, the number of event-initiated sessions, the number of apps used per event initiated session, and the length of non-event-initiated sessions are useful for detecting problematic usage. With these, a detection model can identify users with problematic usage with 89.6% accuracy (F-score of .707).",12,89.6501457726

By tracing the behavior of a person over a long period, we can model their daily routines and predict periodical behaviors, whereas rare behaviors, such as participating in the New Year's Eve countdown, can hardly be predicted readily and thus they have usually been treated as outliers of the daily routines in most existing studies. However, for scenarios such as emergency management or intelligent traffic regulation, we are more interested in rare behaviors than daily routines. Using human mobility Big Data, the rare behavior of each individual in a social crowd is no longer rare and thus it may be predicted when we analyze the crowd behavior at a citywide level. Therefore in this study, instead of predicting movement based on daily routines, we make short-term predictions based on the recent movement observations. We propose a novel model called CityMomentum as a predicting-by-clustering framework for sampling future movement using a mixture of multiple random Markov chains, each of which is a Naive Movement Predictive model trained with the movements of the subjects that belong to each cluster. We apply our approach to a big mobile phone GPS log dataset and predict the short-term future movements, especially during the Comiket 80 and New Year's Eve celebration. We evaluate our prediction by a Earth Mover Distance (EMD) based metric, and show our approach accurately predicts the crowd behavior during the rare crowd events, which makes an early crowd event warning and regulation possible in the emergent situations.",11,90.3361344538

Even though the accelerometer is the most widely used sensor, the highest recognition accuracies are obtained when using data collected from multiple sensors. However, the use of multiple sensors has an adverse impact on the energy consumption of power-limited devices such as smartphones. In this paper, we present a new method to improve the recognition accuracy of physical activities by using only the accelerometer. We utilize a low-pass filter to split the acceleration data into a low- and a high-frequency component. These components provide a new set of features, which can be used as a complement to the raw acceleration to reduce the number of sensors needed to recognize physical activities. After evaluating our method for a public dataset, we found that our approach represents an average of up to 16% increase in the recognition accuracy over the raw acceleration data, outperforming even widely used combinations such as the raw acceleration plus the gyroscope. The highest accuracies are obtained when using a cut-off frequency in the interval [0:001--0:05] Hz as well as a combination of the acceleration with its low-frequency component.",0,6.3025210084

The challenge lies in creating a reliable and customizable touch circuit that is easy to produce. Specifically, it should not require assembly of multiple layers and it should support multiple touch points without needing separate connections to a microcontroller for each touch point.
 We address this through a resistive touch sensor that exploits the inherently high resistance of printed traces to create multiple detectable touch points. The finger closes the circuit when in contact with the touch point and the sensor uses a polarity-switching technique to cancel out the effect of the unknown skin resistance. We evaluated the touch sensor using keypads with 10, 15 and 20 touch points and achieved 99.6%, 93.5%, and 91% touch detection accuracy, respectively.

The electromagnetic noise can be sensed from any point along a home's electrical wiring. This allows users to perform gestures near any CFL lighting fixture, even when multiple lamps are operational. Gestures can be sensed using a single interface device plugged into any electrical outlet. We experimentally show that we can reliably detect hover gestures (waving a hand close to a lamp), touches on lampshades, and touches on the glass part of the bulb itself. Additionally, we show that touches anywhere along the body of a metal lamp can be detected.

We show both analytically and by in-home experimentation that EMI signals are stable and predictable based on the device's switching frequency characteristics. Unlike past transient noise-based solutions, this new approach provides the ability for EMI signatures to be applicable across homes while still being able to differentiate between similar devices in a home.

Advances in methods where regular population patterns with respect to factors such as holidays or weekdays are extracted have provided successful results in irregularity detection. With large-scale crowded events such as fireworks, it is crucial that there be enough time to take countermeasures against the irregular congestion, i.e., irregularity prediction. It remains a tough challenge to predict population from GPS trace logs with existing methods.
 To tackle this problem, we focus here on route search logs, since aggregation of the location-oriented queries of individual plans serves as a mirror of short-term city-scale events, in contrast to GPS mobility logs. This paper presents a brand new framework for city-scale event prediction: CityProphet. By our observation of data where the route search logs related to a future event are in most cases repeatable and accumulated in proportion as the event draws near, we are able to leverage the divergence between the above two properties to predict city-scale irregular events. We demonstrate through experiments using the transit app logs of over 370 million queries that our approach can successfully predict city-scale crowded events one week in advance.",0,39.5652173913

This is why the installation cost is very heavy. We propose a technique to gather data efficiently by using machine learning techniques.

Through controlled experiments, we find that WiFi power management on a wide variety of Smartphones is a largely autonomous process that is processed completely at the driver level. Driver level implementations suffer from the limitation that important power management decisions can be made only by observing packets at the MAC layer. This approach has the unfortunate side effect that each application has equal opportunity to impact WiFi power management to consume more energy, since distinguishing between applications is not feasible at the MAC layer. The power cost difference between WiFi power modes is high (a factor of 20 times when idle), therefore determining which applications are permitted to impact WiFi power management is an important and relevant problem. In this paper we propose SAPSM: Smart Adaptive Power Save Mode. SAPSM labels each application with a priority with the assistance of a machine learning classifier. Only high priority applications affect the client's behavior to switch to CAM or Active mode, while low priority traffic is optimized for energy efficiency. Our implementation on an Android Smartphone improves energy savings by up to 56% under typical usage patterns.",9,78.1105990783

Collective transportation (CT), e.g., public transport systems, provides a partly solution to these issues. Yet, CT does not support door-to-door transportation hence reducing convenience; it might be limited in off-peak hours, and it is still a cost factor when traveling long distances. A solution to these issues is ride sharing, an evolving form of CT making alternative transportation more affordable. In this paper we present a modular, context-aware ride sharing platform.

In this paper we present a number of concepts derived from ethno-graphic studies of routine activities and technology uses implicated in the production and consumption of communication in the home. These concepts sensi-tise design to the importance of the ecology of the domestic space and distributed arrangements of collaboration to communication. They draw attention to the places where communication is accomplished and the routines whereby communication is articulated, thereby highlighting 'prime sites' for situating ubiquitous computing in the domestic environment. The domestic environment is currently receiving a great deal of attention as a place for the development of ubiquitous computing. The technical and methodological challenges involved in realising computing systems for the domestic environment are significant, and require researchers to anticipate facilities that are likely to emerge in the home of the future. Anticipating the future is fraught with difficulties and researchers have tended to exploit purpose built 'living laboratories' in order to explore both the future potential and the shortcomings of current technological infrastruc-tures, and to consider the ways in which inhabitants might experience the home of the future [3, 13, 15]. These explorations have been complemented by design led 'visions of the future' [18] that seek to convey the potential ways in which ubiquitous computing might be deployed in domestic settings. The home offers new sets of challenges that move our understanding of interaction beyond the current focus on information and knowledge work. It exposes us to the demands of new user groups, including the elderly, the disabled and the mentally impaired [14, 5], and requires us to be sensitive to the impact of broader cultural values and the need to support activities other than work [7]. A key research problem in designing for this environment is the need to understand the everyday character of the home: how people live in the home, what they do when they are at home, and the potential role of technologies within the milieu of domestic activities.

We present the design and implementation of small ultra-low-power 27 MHz sensor nodes that transmit their data by coupling over the powerline to a single receiver attached to the powerline in the home. We demonstrate the ability of our general purpose wireless sensor nodes to provide whole-home coverage while consuming less than 1 mW of power when transmitting (65 &#188;W consumed in our custom CMOS transmitter).

Our experiments show that they are surprisingly informative of different types of social actions. The social actions we address in this paper are whether a person is speaking, laughing, gesturing, drinking, or stepping. To our knowledge, this is the first work to carry out experiments on estimating social actions from conversational behavior using only a wearable accelerometer. The ability to estimate such actions using just the acceleration opens up the potential for analyzing more about social aspects of people's interactions without explicitly recording what they are saying.",12,89.6501457726

While <i>data-plan</i> users are mostly concerned about the energy consumption, <i>non-data-plan</i> users are more sensitive to data transmission cost incurred. Traditional ways of data collection in mobile crowdsensing often go to two extremes: either uploading the sensed data online in real-time or fully offline after the whole sensing task is finished. In this paper, we propose effSense - a novel energy-efficient and cost-effective data uploading framework leveraging the <i>delay-tolerant</i> mechanisms. Specifically, effSense reduces the data cost of <i>non-data-plan users</i> by maximally offloading the data to Bluetooth/WiFi gateways or data-plan users encountered to relay the data to the server; it reduces energy consumption of <i>data-plan users</i> by uploading data in parallel with a call or using less-energy demand networks (e.g. Bluetooth). By leveraging the prediction of critical events such as user's future calls or encounters, effSense selects the optimal uploading scheme for both types of users.

Compensating for missing data is one method to improve robustness and can be done by three levels in activity recognition: raw data level, feature value level, and classifier level. Our study proposes a method to compensate for the missing sensor data using an ARAR algorithm and compares this method with a previous method for compensating for the feature value using kernel regression in the feature value level. The ARAR algorithm method predicts future data from existing sequence data. We conducted some experiments to verify the usefulness of the proposed methods. Specifically, the prediction performance was evaluated by applying the ARAR algorithm to compensate for one to five successive windows. As a result of our test data, the F-measure rate was 73.4% in the case of sensor data loss. The ARAR algorithm compensation for one and two successive windows increased the F-measure to 76.8%. Overall, the ARAR algorithm method effectively compensates for instantaneous communication disconnection. On the other hand, the kernel regression method is especially compensates for burst communication disconnection. Therefore, we need to change the compensation method depending on sensor error patterns.

We use mobile phone based co-location and communication sensing to measure characteristic behavior changes in symptomatic individuals, reflected in their total communication, interactions with respect to time of day (e.g., late night, early morning), diversity and entropy of face-to-face interactions and movement. Using these extracted mobile features, it is possible to predict the health status of an individual, without having actual health measurements from the subject. Finally, we estimate the temporal information flux and implied causality between physical symptoms, behavior and mental health.",68,96.3636363636

A distributed system supporting a ubiquitous computing application must deal with a wider spectrum of hardware architectures featuring structural and functional differences, and resources limitations. Due to its architecture independent infrastructure and object-oriented programming model, the Java programming environment can support flexible solutions for addressing the diversity among these devices. Unfortunately, Java solutions are often associated with high costs in terms of resource consumption, which limits the range of devices that can benefit from this approach. In this paper, we present an architecture that deals with the cost and complexity of running Java programs by partitioning the process of Java program execution between system nodes and remote devices. The system nodes prepare a Java application for execution on a remote device by generating device-specific native code and application-specific runtime system on the fly. The resulting infrastructure provides the flexibility of a high-level programming model and the architecture independence specific to Java. At the same time the amount of resources consumed by an application on the targeted device are comparable to that of a native implementation.",12,9.09090909091

Existing studies on this topic mostly treat this kind of recommendation as just a type of friend recommendation. However, apart from making friends, the reason of a user to follow someone in social networks is inherently to satisfy his/her information needs in asymmetrical manner. In this paper, we propose a novel mining-based recommendation approach named Geographic-Textual-Social Based Followee Recommendation (GTS-FR), which takes into account the user movements, online texting and social properties to discover the relationship between users' information needs and provided information for followee recommendation. The core idea of our proposal is to discover users' similarity in terms of all the three properties of information which are provided by the users in a Location-Based Social Network (LBSN). To achieve this goal, we define three kinds of features to capture the key properties of users' interestingness from their provided information. In GTS-FR approach, we propose a series of novel similarity measurements to calculate similarity of each pair of users based on various properties. Based on the similarity, we make on-line recommendation for the followee a user might be interested in following. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on followee recommendation in LBSNs by exploring the geographic, textual and social properties simultaneously. Through a comprehensive evaluation using a real LBSN dataset, we show that the proposed GTS-FR approach delivers excellent performance and outperforms existing stat-of-the-art friend recommendation methods significantly.",1,36.4055299539

Therefore, we compared three possible techniques to solves this problem on the feature value level: a classifier trained with reduced feature values, feature value compensation with multiple regression, and feature value compensation with kernel regression, in a no failure situation. All of these techniques do not depend on classification algorithms. While creating a regression model, which is in the training phase, requires relatively high computational power, compensation itself can work with low computational power.

This paper describes the first working scalable and cost-effective array that offers high-precision localization of conversational speech, and hence enables ongoing studies of verbal interactions in large semi-structured spaces. This work represents significant improvements over prior work in three dimensions -- cost, scale and accuracy. It also achieves high throughput for real-time updates of tens of active sources using off-the-shelf components. We describe the system design, key localization algorithms, and a systematic performance evaluation. We then show how source location data can be usefully aggregated to reveal interesting patterns in group conversations, such as dominance and engagement.",1,36.4055299539

We present new hardware and software for this purpose. The hardware, called SmartMoveX, is an active badge system in which a small radio transmitter is attached to the person being tracked. Receivers placed in the building's existing offices, connected to existing PCs, transmit signal strength readings to a central PC using the building's existing computer network. Combined with the low cost of the hardware, using the existing network makes this active badge system much less expensive than many others. To compute locations based on signal strength, we gathered signal strength readings from prede-fined location nodes in the building. We defined a graph on these nodes, which allowed us to enforce constraints on computed movements between nodes (e.g. cannot pass through walls) and to probabilistically enforce our expectations on transitions between connected nodes. Modeling the data with a hidden Markov model, we used the Viterbi algorithm to compute optimal paths based on signal strengths over the node graph. The average location error was 3.05 meters, which compared favorably to a simple nearest neighbor algorithm's average location error of 4.57 meters.",31,40.0

However, these attacks all rely by some means on the position of targeted users. This requires the attacker to be able to locate either the user or the sensors detecting the user. Implicitly, it also forbids the use of these attacks on devices whose location is unknown.
 In this paper, we consider attack scenarios where the attacker has no position information on users and devices sensing users. Such attack scenarios typically fit Internet of Things use-cases, where low-end devices are scattered in an environment that is unknown to the attacker: the sole source of information is a set of timestamped user/sensor proximity logs.

Our approach exploits location-oblivious logs in two steps: <i>i</i>) we exploit users' flows between sensors to construct a virtual map of the sensors, and <i>ii</i>) we conduct a co-location attack based on that virtual map.

Moreover, to adapt to difference of heart rate variation among individuals, we devise techniques to optimize parameters for each profile-based category of users and to normalize heart rate to absorb individual difference.

Prior work has investigated improvements on toothbrushing with sensing technologies. But existing toothbrushing support focuses mostly on estimating brushing coverage. Users thus only have indirect information about how well their toothbrushing removes dental plaque. We present LumiO, a toothbrush that offers users continuous feedback on the amount of plaque on teeth. Lumio uses a well-known method for plaque detection, called Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence (QLF). QLF exploits a red fluorescence property that bacterium in the plaque demonstrates when a blue-violet ray is cast. Blue-violet light excites this fluorescence property, and a camera with an optical filter can capture plaque in pink. We incorporate this technology into an electric toothbrush to achieve improvements in performance on plaque removal in daily dental care.

In relation to the hardware aspect, the system quantifies degree of battery aging as a ratio metric; an estimate of 50% indicates that the battery is at half of full capacity, meaning that battery usage time is approximately half that of a new battery. The system automatically profiles battery age based on charging duration data collected by crowdsensing.

We address these two problems by leveraging a key insight --- people frequently use data plan on cellphones and leave mobility signatures on cellular networks. Therefore, we are able to exploit these cellular signatures for real-time population estimation.
 Extracting population information from cellular data records is not easy because the number of users recorded by a cellular tower is not equal to the population covered by the tower, and mobile users' behavior is spatially and temporally different, where static estimating model does not work.

To realize SakuraSensor, we face two technical challenges: (1) how to accurately detect flowering cherries and its degree, and (2) how to efficiently find good places of flowering cherries (PoIs) using the participatory sensing technique. For the first challenge, we develop an image analysis method for detecting image pixels that belong to flowering cherries. To exclude artificial objects with similar color to flowering cherries, we also employ fractal dimension analysis to filter out unnecessary image areas. For the second challenge, we propose a method called <i>k-stage sensing</i>. In this method, the interval for sensing (taking a still image and applying the image analysis) by each car is dynamically shortened so that the roads near the already found PoIs are more densely sensed. We implemented SakuraSensor consisting of client-side software for iOS devices and server-side software for a cloud server and conducted experiments to travel cherry-lined roads and record videos by several cars. As a result, we confirmed that our method can identify flowering cherries at about 74 % precision and 84 % recall.

Additionally, the sender dynamically adapts the frame rate with respect to inertial sensor readings in order to keep the scene change between consecutive frames small and prevent strong artifacts from the frame interpolation.",2,45.1895043732

Issues of bri ghtness, oblique projection distortion, focus, obstruction, and display resolut ion are examined. Solutions to some of these problems are described, together with a plan to use a video camera to allow device-free interaction with the pr ojected images. The ED-projector is a practical way to create ubiquitous g raphical interfaces to access computational power and networked data. In particul ar, it is envisioned as an alternative to the carrying of laptops and to the i nstallation of displays in furniture, objects, and walls. In addition, the use of ED-projectors to augment reality without the use of goggles is examined and illustrated with examples. 11Introduction Ubiquitous computing envisions a world where it is possible to have access to computer resources anywhere and anytime to the data and services available through the Internet [1]. Since most of current software and Internet data is designed to b e accessed through a high-resolution graphical interf ace, to truly ubiquitously compute todayusers need devices with reasonable graphical capabi lities. This means carrying laptops everywhere, wearing computer graphics goggl es, or installing monitors and displays on the surfaces of spaces and objects, suc h as desks, fridges, and entrance doors. Or, simply, toresign to the low-resolution displays of mobile pho nes or PDAs. In this paper we explore an alternative approach to create ubiquitous graphical interfaces. Our idea is to couple an LCD/DLP projec tor to a motorized rotating mirror and to a computer graphics system that can correct the distortion caused by oblique projection. As the mirror moves, different surfaces become available to be used as displays. Also, we plan to employ a video camera to detect hand interaction with the projected image using computer vision techniques. Our target is to develop a projection-based system that creates interactive displays everywhere in an environment by transforming a surf ace into a projected "" touch screen. "" Such an Everywhere Displays projector can be installed, for example, on the ceiling of a space, to provide a generic computer i nterface to users in that environment (see Fig. 1).",241,86.3636363636

The prisoners' dilemma is a canonical example of a game analyzed that shows why two individuals might not cooperate each other, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so. In the regular version of the prisoner's dilemma game, collaboration is dominated by betrayal, and as a result, the only possible outcome of the game is for both prisoners to betray the other. Regardless of what the other prisoner chooses one will always gain a greater payoff by betraying the other. Because betrayal is always more beneficial than cooperation, all objective prisoners would seemingly betray the other. This study examined whether subliminal emotional faces influence human's decision-making in the repeated prisoners' dilemma. In this study, subliminal emotional face was the independent variable. According to different emotional valence (happy, neutral or angry) and different present way of emotional faces (a transparent figure, or a backward masking face), the independent variable has 7 levels. So, 84 undergraduates were randomly divided into seven groups, participants in each group were subliminally primed with one kind of unseen face, after which they completed pre-designed negotiations task. The results showed that whatever the way to show subliminal emotional faces: by a transparent figure, or backward masking, both affected human's decision-making. Under the influence of different ways to present subliminal faces, participants choose their own behavior more cooperative or more uncooperative.

Khan, Michelle Karg, Jesse Hoey, Dana Kulic","1912779, 2326840, 1773895, 1768765","Most of the systems for recognition of activities aim to identify a set of normal human activities. Data is either recorded by computer vision or sensor based networks. These systems may not work properly if an unusual event or abnormal activity occurs, especially ones that have not been encountered in the past. By definition, unusual events are mostly rare and unexpected, and therefore very little or no data may be available for training. In this paper, we focus on the challenging problem of detecting unusual temporal events in a sensor network and present three Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based approaches to tackle this problem. The first approach models each normal activity separately as an HMM and the second approach models all the normal activities together as one common HMM. If the likelihood is lower than a threshold, an unusual event is identified. The third approach models all normal activities together in one HMM and approximates an HMM for the the unusual events. All the methods train HMM models on data of the usual events and do not require training data from the unusual events. We perform our experiments on a Locomotion Analysis dataset that contains gyroscope, force sensor, and accelerometer readings. To test the performance of our approaches, we generate five types of unusual events that represent random activity, extremely unusual events, unusual events similar to specific normal activities, no or little motion and normal activity followed by no or little motion. Our experiments suggest that for a moderately sized time frame window, these approaches can identify all the five types of unusual events with high confidence.",10,80.6451612903

Such applications, e.g., environmental monitoring or crowdsourced traffic monitoring, involve numerous individuals that on the one hand continuously contribute sensed data to application servers, and on the other hand consume the information of interest to observe a phenomenon typically in their close vicinity. Energy-efficient and context-aware orchestration of the sensing process with data transmission from sensors through mobile devices into the cloud, as well as from the cloud to mobile devices such that information of interest is served to users in real-time, is essential for such applications, primarily due to battery limitations of both mobile devices and wearable sensors. In addition, the latency of data propagation represents their key quality measure from the user's perspective. Publish/subscribe middleware offers the mechanisms to deal with those challenges: It enables selective real-time acquisition and filtering of sensor data on mobile devices, efficient continuous processing of large data volumes within the cloud, and near real-time delivery of notifications to mobile devices. This paper presents our implementation of a publish/subscribe middleware system which is tailored to the requirements of mobile and resource-constrained environments with a goal to reduce the overall energy consumption in such environments, and proposes a general architecture for mobile crowdsensing applications.

In an alternative approach, consumers who choose to save resources are rewarded with micro-rebates off the price of a service. As a result, the cost of using a service corresponds more closely with the resources used, leading market mechanisms to allocate resources efficiently. A key challenge is designing incentive mechanisms that alter consumer behavior in the desired fashion.

 We present ARIEL, a room localization system that automatically learns room fingerprints based on occupants' indoor movements. ARIEL consists of (1) a zone-based clustering algorithm that accurately identifies in-room occupancy ""hotspot(s)"" using Wi-Fi signatures; (2) a motion-based clustering algorithm to identify inter-zone correlation, thereby distinguishing different rooms; and (3) an energy-efficient motion detection algorithm to minimize the noise of Wi-Fi signatures. ARIEL has been implemented and deployed for real-world testing with 21 users over a 10-month period.

Along the road, one of the robotics community's major tasks is to work on the harmonization of trends, standardization of terms, interfaces and technologies. It is important to keep the scientific and social progress under control through sufficient public outreach and technology dissemination. Along those lines, the <i>IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Society</i> is sponsoring a working group entitled <i>Ontologies for Robotics and Automation</i> that will bridge cutting edge technology to users of the services---the general public. In this paper, the background of the project is presented, the definitions and examples of descriptive systems of relations are described, showing how ontologies can help to address the above challenges.",0,14.5161290323

The method requires no infrastructure and relies on simple sensors routinely used in sensor nodes and smart objects (acceleration , sound). It uses vibration and short, narrow frequency 'beeps' to sample the response of the environment to mechanical stimuli. The method works for specific locations such as 'on the couch', 'in the desk drawer' as well as for location classes such as 'closed wood compartment' or 'open iron surface'. In the latter case, it is capable of generalizing the classification to locations the object has not seen during training. We present the results of an experimental study with a total of over 1200 measurements from 35 specific locations (taken from 3 different rooms) and 12 abstract location classes. It includes such similar locations as the inner and outer pocket of a jacket and a table and shelf made of the same wood. Nonetheless on locations from a single room (16 in the largest one) we achieve a recognition rate of up to 96 %. It goes down to 81 % if all 35 locations are taken together, however the correct location is in the 3 top picks of the system 94 % of the times.",22,42.8571428571

The former recognizes not only ""resting"" or ""walking"" but also user's various living activities such as ""vacuuming"" and ""brushing teeth"" by using a built-in accelerometer and a built-in microphone. The latter engine recognizes the user's means of migration, namely, ""resting,"" ""walking,"" ""running,"" and ""boarding"" by using a built-in accelerometer. It enables users to continuously recognize indoor-outdoor activities by switching between the two engines depending on an acquisition condition of GPS satellites.",9,78.1105990783

We implemented the system using a smartphone and estimated its usefulness with a user test. As a result, the users of our system saw their future diaries and tried to alter their current daily activities.",1,32.361516035

In this paper placement refers to the position within a single body part (e.g, lower arm). We show how, within certain limits and with modest quality degradation, motion sensorbased activity recognition can be implemented in a displacement tolerant way. We first describe the physical principles that lead to our heuristic. We then evaluate them first on a set of synthetic lower arm motions which are well suited to illustrate the strengths and limits of our approach, then on an extended modes of locomotion problem (sensors on the upper leg) and finally on a set of exercises performed on various gym machines (sensors placed on the lower arm). In this example our heuristic raises the displaced recognition rate from 24% for a displaced accelerometer, which had 96% recognition when not displaced, to 82%.",54,83.3333333333

The system consists of wireless tags and a high-speed projector (DMD Discovery 3000), operating in 8kHz, attached on mobility platform. The projector transmits structured light patterns that contain different information in each pixel. Wireless tags can recognize their own locations in projected area by receiving structured light patterns projected from the projector. Since 3D coordinates of individual tag is stored in the system, projection point is estimated with 3D coordinates and pixel coordinates of each tag in projected area. According to the estimated position and orientation, augmented reality content is superimposed. The set of structured light patterns are projected in sufficient speed that human eye can only perceive the superimposed content. We have also evaluated the accuracy of superimposing augmented reality content on real world from moving projection points.",0,12.8

Uses and Gratifications Theory explains that users' motivations for engaging with technology can be divided into instrumental and ritualistic purposes. Instrumental uses of technology are goal-directed and purposeful, while ritualistic uses are habitual and diversionary. In this paper, we provide an empirical account of the nature of instrumental vs. ritualistic use of smartphones based on data collected from 43 Android users over 2 weeks through logging application use and collecting ESM survey data about the purpose of use. We describe the phone-use behaviors users exhibit when seeking instrumental and ritualistic gratifications, and we develop a classification scheme for predicting ritualistic vs. instrumental use with an accuracy of 77% for a general model, increasing to more than 97% with a sliding confidence threshold.
