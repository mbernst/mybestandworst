Chewar, D. Scott McCrickard, Ali Ndiwalana, Chris North, Jon Pryor, David Tessendorf","1709938, 1693753, 2252713, 1796013, 1818151, 2132876","We found that established display design guidelines for focal images cannot be extended to images displayed as a secondary task in a dual-task situation. This paper describes an experiment that determines a new ordering guideline for secondary task image attributes according to human cognitive ability to extract information. The imperative for alternate guidelines is based on the difference in an image's ability to convey meaning, which decreases when moved from a focal to a secondary task situation. Secondary task attribute ordering varies with the level of degradation in the primary task. Furthermore, attribute effectiveness may be particular to types of visual operations relating to cognitive tasks.",13,28.0

Scott McCrickard, Chris North, Maulik Shukla","2949902, 1693753, 1796013, 1850209","People often need to quickly access or maintain awareness of secondary information while busy with other primary tasks. Information visualizations provide rapid, effective access to information, but are generally designed to be examined by users as the primary focus of their attention. The goal of this research is to discover how to design information visu-alizations intended for the periphery and to understand how quickly and effectively people can interpret information vi-sualizations while they are busily performing other tasks. We evaluated how several factors of a visualization (visual density, presence time, and secondary task type) impact peo-ple's abilities to continue with a primary task and to complete secondary tasks related to the visualization. Our results suggest that, with relaxed time pressure, reduced visual information density and a single well-defined secondary task, people can effectively interpret visualizations with minimal distraction to their primary task.",25,68.0

Even though object orientation powerfully and elegantly models many application domains, integration of OO libraries in such systems remains a difficult task. The elegance and simplicity of object orientation is often lost in the integration phase, so combining OO and dataflow concepts is usually limited. We propose a system for visualization and simulation with a generic object-oriented way to simulation design, control and interactivity, which merges OO and dataflow modelling in a single abstraction.

Ebert","2739257, 1701512","Traditionally, volume rendering of medical data has been comprised of transfer functions that map a scalar value, usually a MRI or CT intensity, to an opacity. Corresponding color maps are either selected regardless of the actual physical color of the volume (i.e. greyscale) or predetermined as in photographic volumes. Rarely has the voxel color been used as a means to define the associated opacity value. By using transfer functions that map multi-channel color values(RGB or CIE L * u * v *) to opacity, we can generate compelling and informative renderings that provide consistent boundary extraction throughout the volume. We present renderings of the Visible Human photographic volume using multi-dimensional color-based transfer functions. These functions were constructed by using gradient boundary enhancement techniques in conjunction with volume illustration techniques and incorporating the first and second directional derivatives along the gradient direction. We empirically compare the effectiveness of using the color-based transfer functions and discuss their applications and potential for future development.",9,24.0

We have developed a new approach that allows the interactive rendering and navigation of procedurally-encoded 3D scalar fields by reconstructing these fields on PC class graphics processing units. Since the radial basis functions (RBFs) we use for encoding can provide a compact representation of volumetric scalar fields, the large grid/mesh traditionally needed for rendering is no longer required and ceases to be a data transfer and computational bottleneck during rendering. Our new approach will interactively render RBF encoded data obtained from arbitrary volume data sets, including both structured volume models and unstructured scattered volume models. This procedural reconstruction of large data sets is flexible, extensible, and can take advantage of the Moore's Law cubed increase in performance of graphics hardware.",33,79.1666666667

A terrain is mod-eled by a regular grid, which can be partially refined by local TINs in order to represent morphologically complex terrain parts. The multiresolution models for terrain texture data and geometry data are closely related: The rendering algorithm selects geometry and texture patches based on screen-space error criteria. Multiple texture hierarchies, which may represent different thematic information layers, can be bound to one terrain model. Multiple textures lead to a drastic improvement of visual quality: Topographic textures can be used to provide pixel-precise shading, alpha textures can be used to restrict or to highlight thematic textures. Multiple textures facilitate the development of visual interaction tools such as magic lenses, and texture animations. Multitexturing permits an efficient implementation of these concepts.",2,15.0

Higher-dimensional classification makes it easier to differentiate material classes since more data properties are considered. One of the difficulties in using higher-dimensional classification is the absence of appropriate user interfaces. We introduce an intuitive user interface that allows the user to work in the cluster space, which shows the material classes with a set of material widgets, rather than work in the transfer function space. This interface not only provides the user the capability to specify arbitrary-dimensional transfer functions, but also allows the user to operate directly on the classification and visualization results.",49,94.4444444444

Wernert","1730461, 1699457, 2685715","We address the problem of interacting with scenes that contain a very large range of scales. Computer graphics environments normally deal with only a limited range of orders of magnitude before numerical error and other anomalies begin to be apparent, and the effects vary widely from environment to environment. Applications such as astrophysics, where a single scene could in principle contain visible objects from the subatomic scale to the intergalactic scale, provide a good proving ground for the multiple scale problem. In this context, we examine methods for interacting continuously with simultaneously active astronomical data sets ranging over 40 or more orders of magnitude. Our approach relies on utilizing a single scale of order 1.0 for the definition of all data sets. Where a single object, like a planet or a galaxy, may require moving in neighborhoods of vastly different scales, we employ multiple scale representations for the single object; normally, these are sparse in all but a few neighborhoods. By keying the changes of scale to the pixel size, we can restrict all data set scaling to roughly three orders of magnitude. Navigation problems are solved by designing constraint spaces that adjust properly to the large scale changes, keeping navigation sensitivity at a relatively constant speed in the user's screen space.",10,60.0

The system is realized using fuzzy logic control, which enables run-time adaptation based on iterative feedback control and knowledge acquired from past experience.

Since these stream surfaces tend to hide each other as well as other topological features, for complex 3D topologies the visualizations become cluttered and hardly interpretable. One solution of this problem is the recently introduced concept of saddle connectors which treats separation surfaces emanating from critical points. In this paper we extend this concept to separation surfaces starting from boundary switch curves. This way we obtain a number of particular stream lines called boundary switch connectors. They connect either two boundary switch curves or a boundary switch curve with a saddle. We discuss properties and computational issues of boundary switch connectors and apply them to topologically complex flow data.",35,83.3333333333

A spherical partition scheme is proposed to traverse the data blocks in a layered front-to-back order. Such traversal order helps our algorithm to identify the visible isosurface blocks more quickly with fewer visibility queries.

It allows scientists to focus on regions of interest and track their evolution and interaction over time. To allow the user to freely explore the data set, features must be tracked in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present an efficient time-varying isosurface tracking algorithm. Unlike the previous algorithms which compute the corresponding isosurface components in the adjacent time steps by performing expensive computation at run time, our algorithm can rapidly identify corresponding isosurfaces by performing simple table lookup operations. This table, called the correspondence lookup table, can be computed at a preprocessing stage. The idea behind our approach is that the correspondence relationship can only change at critical isovalues in R<sup>3</sup> or R<sup>4</sup> and remains unchanged between adjacent pairs of critical isovalues.

It can also very quickly be perceived, and therefore provides an efficient visual channel.

We present a three pass algorithm, which makes efficient use of this feature. Our geo-scientific sub-surface data sets consist typically of a set of high resolution height fields, polygonal objects, and volume slices and lenses. For each height field, we compute a low and high resolution version in a pre-process and divide both into sets of corresponding tiles. For each tile and for the polygonal objects, the first rendering pass computes a z-buffer image using the low resolution tiles, the polygonal objects and the non-transparent volume objects. During the second pass, we render the same objects against the z-buffer of the first pass while submitting an occlusion query with each object. The third pass reads this occlusion information back from the graphics hardware and renders only those high resolution objects, for which the corresponding low resolution objects were not completely occluded. To avoid fill rate bottle necks, the first two passes may be rendered to a low resolution window. Our implementation shows frame rate improvements for all test cases while introducing only a small overhead and no or hardly noticeable errors. Our non-conservative approach does not require front to back sorting and it works for dynamic scenes.",2,13.8888888889

The direction can be adjusted to coincide with visual trends in the data. Projecting the data onto the orthogonal subspace allows determining the next direction. The set of directions identified in this way forms an orthogonal space, which represents most of the variation in the data. We call this process visual component analysis (VCA). Furthermore, it is quite simple to integrate VCA with clustering. The user fits poly-lines to the displayed data, and the poly-lines implicitly define clusters.
