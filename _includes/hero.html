        We look up to researchers for the best papers they wrote. But success wasn't some simple journey for them either. They took risks that didn't pay off as much as they hoped, they had bumps along the way, just like everyone. On this page, researchers have opted in to report not just their most highly cited paper from graduate school, but also one of their grad school papers that didn't become as highly cited.
